 ixIf philosophy begins in a certain perplexity
towards the world, then per- ha p s  thi s  p e rp l e xi
ty  i s  r es o l v e d  in  lif e .  H o w e v e r ,  in  p hil o s o p h y  (
as  in   the world . . .), “life” is never a simple
affair. More often than not, life is  understood
to be something that, though it is not lived 
exclusively by hu- man beings, is, however,
thought  exclusively by human beings. In fact,
it  could even be said that it is this capacity to
think that which is lived— sometimes to the
point that the two coincide—that has come to
tradition-ally defi  ne the task of philosophy.
“Life” is a troubling and contradictory
concept. Its metamorphic qual- ity is
witnessed in the essentialist concept of “life
itself” as information, in the twofold
approach to life as at once scientifi  c and
mystical, in the  return of vitalisms of all
types, and in the pervasive politicization of
life. T oday , in an era of biopolitics, it seems
that life is everywhere at stake, and yet it is
nowhere the same. The question of how and
whether to value life is at the core of
contemporary debates over bare life and the
state of exception. At another level, in our
scientifi  c worldview, it seems that life  is
claimed of everything, and yet life in itself is
nothing. While biologists continue to debate
whether or not a virus is living, the advances in
genetic engineering and artifi  cial life have,
in different ways, deconstructed the  idea that
life is exclusively natural or biological. We
also live in a time in which events at the
micro-level are also events at the
macro-level: the increasing frequency of
global pandemics and the prevalence of natural
disasters are events that are at once local and
global, molecular and plane-tary. While human
beings or human groups are obviously involved
in such events, there is also a sense in which
such events are beyond human com-prehension.
In short, life is human-centered and yet
unhuman-oriented. In each of these cases,
thought and life approach a horizon of absolute

 x preface incommensurability; the thought of
life becomes increasingly disjunctive  with
the vague set of phenomena we call “life
itself.” Where, then, should one begin such an
inquiry? Too often the concept of life is
understood to be a specifi  cally modern one,
resulting in a rather predictable stratifi  ca-
tion: the foundation of biological life, and
above it, the ascendant layers of human
ethical, social, and political life. Such
stratifi  ed thinking is a  direct descendant of
Aristotle, who organizes life in an ascending
pyramid  of plant (nutritive; growth and
decay), animal (sensate and mobile), and
hu-man (reason, consciousness) forms of life,
adding to this the famous “po-litical animal”
that is political life. Against this stratifi 
cation one can ask  simple but far-reaching
questions: What if life is not reducible to
biology—but also not reducible to
“consciousness,” “spirit,” or “intellect”?
What if life is never self-evident in lived
experience? However, once one entertains
these questions, a whole host of other
questions present themselves. The very
concept of life itself begins to dissolve and
dissipate, while still re-maining in use and in
circulation. What if life is not assumed to
reach its pinnacle in human life? What if life is
only incidentally, and not funda-mentally, an
anthropocentric phenomenon? And what if life
actually has very little to do with the presumed
self-evident nature of the living? After  Life
is a book that addresses the ontology of life in
Western philoso- phy. It does this not in order
to formulate a new or an alternative theory  of
life, but in order to begin articulating a
critique  of life. That critique  begins with a
proposition and an observation. The
proposition is the fol-lowing: Every ontology
of “life” thinks of life in terms of
something-other- than-life . As we will see,
that “something-other-than-life” is most
often a  metaphysical concept, such as time and
temporality , form and causality , or spirit and
immanence. From this follows an observation,
which is re-ally the core of this book: “Life” is
not only a problem of philosophy, but  a problem
for philosophy . In other words, life is not only
inscribed by re- gional discourses (for
instance, theology or biology), but in many
instances it effects a reversal whereby it
describes fundamental ontology, shoring up
its limits and internal contradictions.
Tracing the twists and turns of how this happens
in philosophy is one of the book’s aims.
Needless to say, undertaking such a project is
daunting. There are, to  begin with, historical
and disciplinary issues to consider—the
concept of the “life-principle” in Aristotle
is markedly different from how it was
understood by Aquinas, and the entire
understanding of life and nature dramatically
changes when one moves to adjacent fi  elds such
as natural  theology or natural history. There
are also formal issues to consider, in the 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

  preface xi continuities and discontinuities
between any two thinkers, be it in terms  of a
debate (for example, the debate between
Aquinas and Duns Scotus on the concept of the
creature), or in terms of infl  uence (for
example, the role  that Duns Scotus and other
Scholastic thinkers play in Gilles Deleuze’ s 
philosophy). Finally, there is the issue of
periodization to consider. Should a book that
attempts to unpack philosophical refl  ection
on life also be a  history of the concept of life?
If so, how should one avoid the undue amass-ing
of names and books that such a summary
necessarily demands? If his-torical
continuity is not an issue, then how should one
approach the issue of continuity without
assuming that a given concept such as life has a
universality? These questions are questions
of method. And, while this book does  not answer
all of them defi  nitively, a number of decisions
have neverthe- less been made. The fi  rst is that
philosophical questions often take prece-
dence over historical ones; this means,
simply, that in tracing the ontol-ogy of life
priority has been given to the morphology of
that concept as it shifts historical and
philosophical contexts. While this book does
not aim to construct a history of the concept of
life, it does focus on several major threads
that emerge from Aristotle and reach a point of
culmination in Kant, while passing through
early modern philosophy. In this way, this book
approaches the ontology of life as being shaped
by  the premodern context of what I will be
calling post-Aristotelian Scholas-tic
philosophy. This is a broad and uneven
tradition in which the concept of life is
situated in a zone that is neither quite biology
nor quite theology, with something called
“philosophy” often playing the role of
mediator. I will be using the terms
“Scholastic” and “Scholasticism” in a number
of ways. In a more conventional, stricter
sense, the terms refer to the philoso-phy
produced by theologian-philosophers in the
twelfth- and thirteenth-century European
university. In a less conventional and broader
sense, the terms “Scholastic” and
“Scholasticism” will also refer to a range of
speculative modes—from the poetry of
mysticism to the analytical rigor of the
commentary—that take up the conceptual
framework set out by Aristotle’s De Anima  and
the various forms of Aristotelianism that
follow  upon it (some of which are
indistinguishable from forms of Neoplatonism
or mystical theology)—and, in particular,
those speculative modes that re-fl ect on a
cluster of concepts that themselves are
constellated around the  idea of “life” (e.g.,
“soul,” “creature,” “nature”). The
implication that runs throughout this book is
that any attempt  t o  c o n s tru c t  an  o n t o l o gy  o f  lif
e  m u s t  c o nfr o n t  th e  c h all e n g e s  p u t  f o rth  by the

Scholasticism. One of the cen-

 xii preface tral questions raised by this
tradition is the following: to what extent is  it
possible to formulate an ontology of life that
is neither reducible to bi-ology nor
sublimated within theology? As we will see, the
terms of this are set out by Aristotle,
particularly in the De Anima , and are taken up  in
a variety of ways by Neoplatonic, negative
theological, and Scholastic 
philosophies—and in ways that frustrate the
veneer of modernity’s dis- tinct disciplinary
boundaries of biology, theology, and
philosophy. These challenges in thinking
“life” reach a certain pitch in Kant, who both
re-vives Aristotle while attempting to
resolve the antinomies that the con-cept of
“life” evokes. If choosing a place to start is
difficult, choosing a place to end is even  more
challenging. To open with Aristotle and to
close with Kant would seem to foreclose a whole
host of philosophers and ideas that have come to
defi  ne modernity. This is, to be sure, an
unavoidable pitfall. Suffice it  to say that one
of the conclusions of After Life  is that a
fundamental shift  occurs in the ontology of
life after Kant—a shift in which the
Aristotelian framework still remains but the
responses radically change. This has
ne-cessitated a separate study
altogether—entitled Darklife —could be
viewed  as the “sequel” to this book. At its core,
After Life  isolates two traditions that
address the ontology  of life: the fi  rst is the
dominant thread of post-Aristotelian,
Thomist Scho- lasticism, which constructs an
ontology of life that is superlative,
analogi-cal, and governed by transcendent
emanation. The second tradition is a more
radical, “heretical” orientation in which
life is defi  ned by negation, 
univocity-equivocity, and the concept of
pantheistic immanence. In this eclectic
strain of heretical Scholasticism, we will
examine the thought of philosophers such as the
Pseudo-Dionysius, John Scottus Eriugena,
John Duns Scotus, Nicholas of Cusa, and
Benedict de Spinoza. Along the way, these
Scholastic thinkers will be si tuated wi thin
the framework of con-temporary philosophy,
including treatments of Gilles Deleuze’s own
en-gagement with Scholasticism and
biophilosophy. Additionally, the book also
contains three short “ellipses” that consider
the ontology of life in comparison to Arabic,
Chinese, and Japanese philosophies of the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries. These
should be read not as fully worked-out
ar-guments, but as initial attempts to think
the concept of life across very different
philosophical trajectories. After Life  is
organized into three chapters. Each discusses
a philosoph- ical concept of life in terms of
something other than life: life defi  ned in 
terms of time and temporality (“Superlative
Life”), life defi  ned in terms  of form and fi 
nality (“Univocal Creatures”), and life defi 
ned in terms of 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
  preface xiii spirit and immanence (“Dark
Pantheism”). Each culminates in a tension 
between orthodoxy and heresy, dominant and
minoritarian conceptions of life: in the
“Superlative Life” chapter, life as nothing
(nihil ) is poised  against the dominant concept
of life as generosity or gift; in the “Univocal 
Creatures” chapter, life as univocal or
equivocal is poised against life as
analogical; and in the “Dark Pantheism”
chapter, life as “dark” or empty immanence is
poised against life as transcendent
emanation. I n  e a c h  c h a p t e r ,  a n  o n t o l o g y  o f  l i f e 
i s  f o l l o w e d  t o  i t s  c o n c l u s i o n ,   whereby a
contradiction is revealed that is fundamental
for that ontol-ogy itself: life as affirmation
and negation (life as time), life as additive
and subtractive (life as form), and life as
interiority and exteriority (life as spirit).
What results is a set of fundamental
contradictions inherent in the concept of
life, contradictions that are logically
coherent, and yet ontologi-cally necessary.
Thus one of the main questions we will consider
in this book is the following:  in what way does
the Aristotelian ontology of life  actually
necessitate a set of logically coherent
contradictions? Arguably, we are still under
the spell of this conceptual framework. If the 
question of Being was the central issue for
antiquity (resurrected in the twentieth
century by Heidegger), and if the question of
God, as alive or dead, was the central issue for
modernity (Kierkegaard, Marx, Nietzsche),
then perhaps the question of “life” is the
question that has come to defi  ne  our
contemporary era . . . Consider the three major
modes in the philosophical engagement with 
“life” today—the
affective-phenomenological, the
biopolitical, and the politico-theological.
It would seem that the classical framework set
out by Aristotle, and developed by
post-Aristotelian Scholasticism, still
in-forms philosophical refl  ection on “life”
today—life as time (the  affective- p h e n o m e n o l
o g i c a l ) ,  l i f e  a s  f o r m  ( t h e  b i o p o l i t i c a l ) ,  a n d  l
i f e  a s  s p i r i t  ( t h e  politico-theological). In
the fi  rst case, there has been a steady
loosening of the concept of  life in th e “ n ew vi
talisms ” of affecti vi ty , process , an d self
-organiza ti on. On the one hand, phenomenology
descended from Merleau-Ponty and Mi-chel
Henry has reframed life less in terms of its
scientifi  city and more in  terms of its
embodiment and affective époché , its
propensity for “auto-  affection.” Despite its
incommensurability with phenomenology,
philoso- phies inspired by Deleuze and Bergson
have pointed to a concept of life that is defi  ned
by its immanently dynamic, self-organizing,
and germinal  qualities. Life is in this case
neither a quality that a body has, nor a vital
force separate from a thing that is vitalized,
but the priority of immanence 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    13
    </p></div><p>
    
 xiv preface in itself, a continuum or network of
affects in which individuated subjects  are
more effects than causes. In the second case,
life is politically at stake in Giorgio
Agamben’s  notions of “bare life” and
“form-of-life,” creating a state of exception
in  which, as Antonio Negri notes, “ all politics
is biopolitics. ” More specifi  - cally, the
so-called post-9/11 era has reinvigorated the
fi  gure of the body  politic and, as Jacques
Derrida notes, its “autoimmunitary
disorders,” in which every instance of
community is doubled by immunity, or by what
Roberto Esposito calls an “immunization
paradigm” of boundaries and boundary
management. The publication and translation
of Michel Fou-cault’s lectures at the Collège
de France have prompted new views on
bio-politics, foregrounding the role that
political economy, war, and technosci-ence
have had on the concept of “population.” But the
concept of “life” is not simply about this
ambivalent conjunc- tion of biology and
politics—today it is also being extended
across broad swaths of social, economic, and
cultural existence. Building on the prior work
on religion by Heidegger and Derrida,
philosophers as wide- ranging  as Mark C.
Taylor, Luc Ferry, Jean-Luc Marion, and Slavoj
Žižek have each noted the ambivalent relations
between the qualifi  ed  s o c ial  lif e  o f   bíos and
the religious or spiritual life, be it of the
individuated subject  or of a  community—real,
imaginary, or “to come.” Furthermore, “life”
is  fi rst and foremost the experience of living,
and this life-experience—once  the hallmark of
modernity and its existentialist
preoccupations with  authenticity—is still
the center of the experience of life today,
mediated,  simulated, and virtualized in a
range of ways, culminating in the
metasta-bility of what Zygmunt Bauman calls
“liquid life.” These three contemporary
strands fi  nd their point of tension in politi-
cal refl  ection on “life,” where what is at stake
is not just the thing or the  self, but the qualifi 
ed life, the life worth living, the life that is
part of the  body politic. Thus it should be no
surprise that the life of the body politic also
ascends to, or descends from, the moral,
ethical, and spiritual life, be it of an
individuated subject or a collectivized
community. Beyond this, or outside of this,
there is only the nebulous realm of the
life-after-life, a neg-ative theology of that
paradoxical life that can never be lived. The
study of such a life-after-life would seem to
require a kind of “supernatural phi-losophy”
adequate to the task—that is, a
supernaturalism that would not be a
superhumanism. But such a philosophy would
have to be as skeptical of the reductionism of
the philosophy of biology as of the dogmatism of
the various theologies of life; it would have to
refuse both organism and spirit as the
exemplars of life.

  preface xv This leads to the two central
challenges that this book puts forward  for any
speculation on “life” today. One of these
challenges is to refuse  a dichotomous concept
of life, as caught between the poles of
reduction-ism and mysticism, scientifi  city
and religiosity, the empirical and the ro-
mantic notions of life. Caught between these
poles, life appears at once as the exclusive
domain of technoscience, and as the privileged
domain of an eschatological religious
extremism. This opens onto a second
chal-lenge, and this is the pervasive
anthropomorphism of the concept “life.” It is
often noted that it is only human beings that
worry about the defi  nition  of life—the rest of
the world simply lives it. This is undoubtedly
related to  the long-standing tradition in
Western thought to regard life specifi  cally  as
the life for us as human beings. Life is, at least
from Aristotle onwards,  a concept that is
highly stratifi  ed, the view down from on top of a
pyramid  of increasing complexity. But if the
existence of disasters, pandemics, and 
nonhuman networks tells us anything, it is that
there is another world in addition to the world
that is there “for us.” This is not simply a world
in itself, and neither is it a world that is
destined for us—rather, it is a world that
presents us with the very limits of our ability
to comprehend it in terms that are neither
simply that of the “in itself” or the “for us.” It
is a world “without us” (the life sans soi ). It is
the challenge of thinking a  concept of life that
is foundationally, and not incidentally, a
nonhuman or unhuman concept of life. h A few
words of acknowledgment are in order. A
research leave from the Georgia Institute of
Technology enabled me to make substantial
progress on this book, and I am especially
grateful to Kenneth Knoespel for his on-going
collegiality and encouragement. At the
University of Chicago Press, Alan Thomas’s
enthusiasm, openness, and support for this
project have been indispensable, and the
Press’s staff has made the publication process
an enjoyable one. A number of the ideas in this

the early twentieth century a unique literary
genre emerged that com- bined horror, myth, and
developments in science and technology. The 
stories tended to be concept-driven rather
than plot- or character-driven,  and, though
they often utilized well-known motifs such as
the mad scien-tist or alien invasion, more
often than not they moved towards a singular
affect: the terrifying and sublime
conclusions to be drawn from a view of the world
as an utterly unhuman world. Writers such as H.
P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Frank
Belknap  Long, and Robert E. Howard are often
associated with this type of writing, which
appeared throughout the early twentieth
century in pulp magazines such as Weird Tales ,
Amazing Stories , and the like. The pulp
magazines  d u b b e d  t h i s  k i n d  o f  w r i t i n g  “ w e i r d  fi 
ction,” though Lovecraft himself  preferred
the more literary term “supernatural horror.”
Its mid-twentieth-century inheritors were TV
shows such as Twilight Zone  and Outer Lim- its,
and its contemporary infl  uence can be felt in
the Japanese horror boom  of the late twentieth
and early twenty-fi  rst centuries. I mention
this “cult” tradition because many of the
stories contain  thought-provoking insights
into the concept of “life”—and, specifi  cally, 
into the limits of such a concept when it is
thought of in exclusively  human-centric
terms. Consider the late-period works of
Lovecraft as an chapter one Life and the Living 
(On Aristotelian Biohorror)

 2 chapter one example. In these stories, one
often fi  nds three forms of life: There is, fi 
rst,  the world of the living and the nonliving
(plants, animals, human beings),  existing
within the human-centric world of society,
politics, and science. This is a world in which
we fi  nd characters weighted down by deeply in-
grained ways of thinking about the world—rural
vs. urban, regional vs. global, civilized vs.
primitive, race vs. species, ancient vs.
modern, and so on. In the midst of this
all-too-human world, Lovecraft’s characters
dis-cover remnants—often at a distant,
furtive archaeological dig—of an ad-vanced
form of life that confounds all human knowledge
about life as we know it. These types of
beings—the “Old Ones”—are often
characterized a s  a n  a d v a n c e d  r a c e  o f  o t h e r - d i m
e n s i o n a l  b e i n g s  t h a t  a r e  d i s c o v e r e d  t o  have
existed eons prior to the appearance of human
beings. This is the life that is so ancient it is
alien. 1 This in itself is cause for horror for
Lovecraft’s characters. The  strange, alien
facticity of the remnant throws into abeyance
all human   presupposition—history, biology,
geology, cosmology—concerning the hu- man and
its relation to the world. This alone qualifi  es
Lovecraft’s stories  as science fi  ction. But
there is another element that pushes the works
into  that intermediary zone of supernatural
horror and “the weird.” In addition to these two
forms of life, there is also a third form of life
that appears in Lovecraft’s stories. This
third form of life often resists easy
description, either in terms of the human
world, or in terms of the Old Ones. Some-times
this third form of life is given an awkward name,
such as “Elder Things” or “Shoggoths.” Clark
Ashton Smith once used the term “Ubbo-Sathla,”
while Frank Belknap Long used the phrase “the
Space-Eaters.” William Hope Hodgson
preferred the more menacing and shapeless term
“the Watchers.” However, while this form of
life is often named, more of-ten than not it
represents the very horizon of human thought to
think this third form of life at all—hence
Lovecraft’s characters obliquely refer to
them as the “nameless thing”—or better, in
Ambrose Bierce’s phrase, “the damned thing.”
This third form of life is, then, the nameless
thing that is living, with  all the
contradictions this implies. It is described
by Lovecraft’s charac-t ers  in  w a ys  tha t  are 
poeti c  an d  highl y  arti cula t e.  In  “ T h e  S ha do w  Ou
t  of Time,” for instance, the central character
not only discovers remnants that this third
form of life had actually once been alive, but,
to his horror, he also discovers that they are
still alive. The narrator begins, in a
classi-cally unreliable mode, by evoking the
unreality of his situation: “Dream, madness,
and memory merged wildly together in a series of
fantastic, frag-mentary delusions which can
have no relation to anything real.” But this 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    18
    </p></div><p>
    
  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 3 is not enough, for what is then
evoked is the strange objectivity of these de-
lusions: “There was a hideous fall through
incalculable leagues of viscous, sentient
darkness, and a babel of noises utterly alien to
all that we know of the earth and its organic
life.” Finally, the delusion itself is
revealed to be not only something “real,” but,
more importantly, something dormantly alive:
“Dormant, rudimentary senses seemed to start
into vitality within me, telling of pits and
voids peopled by fl  oating horrors and leading
to sun-less crags and oceans and teeming cities
of windowless basalt towers upon which no light
ever shone.” 2 There is more here than the
menacing monster of classic creature-  feature
fi  lms. In these passages, what is horrifi  c is
not just that such name- less things are still
alive, but, more importantly, that in their
living they  evoke in Lovecraft’s characters
the limits of thought—the limits of thought to
think “life” at all. The very terms of human
thought fail to encompass the nameless thing.
In Lovecraft’s novel At the Mountains of
Madness one  of the central characters attempts
to describe the  Shoggoths—an oozing 
hyper-complex form of life composed of
mathematically grouped dots and a multitude of
eyes: Formless protoplasm able to mock and refl 
ect all forms and organs and  processes—viscous
agglutinations of bubbling cells—rubbery  fi
fteen- foot spheroids infi  nitely plastic and
ductile—slaves of suggestion,  builders of
cities—more and more sullen, more and more
intelligent,  more and more amphibious, more
and more imitative . . . 3 Lovecraft’s
characters are not insane—in fact, the source
of their horror  is the realization that they are
not hallucinating or suffering from
“ex-hausted nerves.” With the requisite
melodramatic fl  air, Lovecraft’s charac- ters
often express the wish that they were simply
hallucinating or dream-ing, for then they
could dismiss what they encounter as pure
subjectivism, and the self-world dichotomy
would remain intact. The problem is that
Lovecraft’s characters come to verify this
third form of life—but in a man-ner that is
incommensurate to any form of rational verifi 
cation. The very  categories of matter and form,
actual and potential, origin and fi  nality, 
growth, decay, and organization—all these
categories of thought fl  ounder  before a form of
life that is at once oozing and mathematical,
formless and geometric. This third kind of
life, the “nameless thing” so often described
by Love- craft, is a paradigm for the concept of
life today. The concept of life en-

 4 chapter one compasses so much, from the most
reductive biological viewpoint to the  most
open-ended ethical or existential viewpoint.
When defi  nitions or cri- teria for life are
given, even these are subject to modifi  cation
and revision.  There is a sense in which the major
problem concerning life has to do not  with its
defi  nition, and whether such a defi  nition is
possible, but with the  very plasticity  of life,
a shape-shifting quality exhibited in all the
different  ways in which we use the concept to
correlate to the different phenomena that are
deemed to be living—the plasticity of all the
different ways in which life is thought and
shaped, all the myriad ways in which life refl 
ects  upon itself and shapes itself, all the
forms of existence, resistance, and
insistence that life is. This invites us to
consider a more general set of problems
concerning  the concept of life today. We can
briefl  y summarize some of these. There  is, fi
rst, the polyvalence of meanings for “life.”
Here life means so many  things that it does not
mean any one thing. If the concept of life
encom-passes everything from the physical
organism, to socioeconomic living
conditions, to the life that is subject to
ethical and legal decision-making, to the
entire planet itself, then there is a sense in
which almost nothing is excluded from life.
This is a synchronic dimension in which, at any
given moment, and in any given context, there
are such a wide range of mean-ings for “life”
that the term ceases to have any stable meaning
at all. The limit of this is, of course,
relativism. If life means everything, then
life means nothing. Despite this polyvalence
of meanings, some can be viewed as more  d o minan t 
than  o th e r s .  H e r e  th e  a p p ar a tu s  o f  s o c i al  n o rm s
,  di s c i p linary  specialization, and
institutional legitimacy all come into play.
Although everything and anything may come
under the term “life,” there is also a sense in
which some things are more living, or more
essentially living, than others. The hegemony
of scientifi  c concepts of “life” has had an im-
pact that reaches far beyond scientifi  c
specialization. Here “life” is that  which
fulfi  lls a descriptive list of behavioral
criteria in natural systems  (Does it contain
DNA? Does it display adaptive evolutionary
behavior? Do es  i t  main tain  i ts e lf  b y  e x c
hanging  ma tt e r  an d  e n e r gy  wi th  i ts  e n vi
-ronment?). This is as true of biology
historically speaking as it is in cur-rent fi 
elds such as systems biology, biocomplexity,
or even astrobiology.  Whereas the polyvalence
of meanings of life point to a synchronic
dimen-sion, the scientifi  c hegemony of life
points to a diachronic one. The sci- entifi  c
grounding of the concept of life obtains a
normative power that  itself may change over
time (from mechanism to vitalism to
organization to information, and so on). The
limit of this is not relativism but rather 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 5 reductionism. In some instances
this becomes a case of checking off the 
appropriate boxes. However, this specialist
notion of life is doubled by its opposite, which 
is the banalization of the term “life” in
everyday language. In English, one  regularly
hears the phrases “lifestyle,” “quality of
life,” “that’s life!,” “get a life!,” and so on.
Often this quotidianism points to the central
category of experience in relation to life. And
experience itself comes to overlap almost
perfectly with the concept of life; there is no
experience of life, be-cause experience is
life. Life is the fl  ux and fl  ow of living in the
world; life  is the experience of being alive, of
living in time and through time. Un-like the
above cases, in which the concept of life is
distributed along syn-chronic and diachronic
axes, here life obtains a pragmatic quality, as
the very phenomenon of life in its being lived.
Life is simply the experience of living, and
vice-versa. But this too has a limit, and that is
universalism. Everything that happens to a
person is part of this fl  ux and fl  ow of life.  Life
becomes everything and anything that can
possibly be experienced, and what can be
experienced becomes the totality of life. This
leads to a fourth usage of the concept. When life
is taken as sub- jective experience, life is
projected from subject to object, self to
world, and human to nonhuman. Another name for
this process is anthropomor-phism. The life
that is fully commensurate with experience and
the phe-nomena of living tends to become a life
that is rooted in a living, experi-encing
subject. And, since a refl  exive awareness of
living is implied in the  very idea of life as
experience, this also means that life becomes a
human-centric concern. Life in this sense
really means life-for-me, or life-for-us.
This has clear political implications. Life is
the privilege of designation and the status
that designation accords. Life is granted or
taken away, not given. Life is classifi  ed or
stratifi  ed; perhaps it is designated rights,
perhaps  one speaks for this or that form of life,
perhaps some lives are more worth living than
others. Life may be named, constructed,
instrumentalized, it may itself become a form
of power. This is not simply a pragmatic
dimen-sion, but a political or biopolitical
one. The difficulty here lies precisely in this
nexus between “life” and “politics,” for if
life is not exclusive to the human, or a
privilege of the human, then the question
becomes: can there be a politics of life in terms
of the nonhuman or the unhuman? These are the
contours of any attempt to think the concept of
“life.” The  effects can be seen not just in the
cultural expressions of these problems, but in
the metamorphoses of the concept itself—its
variability, its labil-ity, its plasticity.
However, with so many defi  nitions of life, and
so much 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
 6 chapter one knowledge produced about this or
that form of life, the more basic question  of
“life itself” does not disappear. In fact, it
becomes more pronounced. In other words, the
various and often competing epistemologies of
life in the end point back to a more fundamental
question concerning an ontology  of  life . . . and
to what extent such an ontology is possible. It
is for this reason that a return to Aristotle’s
project is worthwhile.  But let us be clear. This
is not to suggest that Aristotle provides any
new  perspectives or alternatives, much less an
“answer” to the question of life. What we can
suggest is that Aristotle sets out a framework
for thinking about life whose infl  uence can
still be discerned to this day. That frame- work
is really a limit—and it is a limit that must be
“overcome” if we are to continue thinking about
our current situation of biopolitics and
necrop-olitics, immunity and community, bare
life and precarious life, and so on. And the key
to moving beyond the Aristotelian paradigm
lies not in the search for an alternative
perspective; what is needed is not a new theory
of life, and not an undiscovered, forgotten, or
underappreciated alterna-tive. What is
needed is a critique  of life. And the key to
overcoming the  Aristotelian ontology of life
lies in the fi  ssures within that ontology. We 
are jumping ahead a little here, but for the time
being suffice it to say that these fi  ssures are
not lacunae or lapses in argument—rather, they
entail  the development of  a logically
coherent, and yet a necessarily contradic-
tory concept of “life.” 1.2 ARISTOTLE’S DE
ANIMA AND THE PROBLEM OF LIFE The text given the
title De Anima  occupies a strange position
within the  Aristotelian corpus. On the one
hand, it undertakes an investigation into the
principle or essence of life, and thus overlaps
with the ontological concerns of the
Metaphysica  and the logical treatises. On the
other hand,  this ontology is concerned not with
“being” or “substance” in itself, but specifi 
cally with the phenomena of life, suggesting
that the De Anima  is  more a natural philosophy.
This aligns the De Anima  with the so-called 
biological treatises, such as Historia
Animalium  (On the History of Ani- mals ), De
Partibus Animalium ( On the Parts of Animals ),
De Motu Ani- malium  (On the Movement of Animals
), De Generatione et Corruptione  (On
Generation and Corruption ), and the various
treatises given the title  Parva Naturalia .
This distinction is also played out in
Aristotle’s biogra- phy. Between his time as a
student of Plato in the Academy, and his re-turn
to Athens later in life to found his own school,
the Lyceum, Aristotle spends a number of years
in and around the eastern Aegean, where he ob-

  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 7 serves, describes, and catalogs
the diversity of natural life. No doubt this 
period in exile comes to be foundational for
Aristotle’s natural philosophy. In this way,
there are two Aristotles—there is
Aristotle-the- naturalist, de- scribing
animal anatomy and physiology, and the vital
processes of growth  and decay, and there is
Aristotle-the-metaphysician, developing
funda-mental metaphysical concepts
concerning substance, accident, causality,
form, and so on. In the De Anima  these two
Aristotles come head-to-head,  resulting in a
number of interesting contradictions. Before
delving into this text, a bit of an overview is in
order. In its  surviving form, the text of the De
Anima —whose original title is Peri  Psukhe ˉ—is
divided into three parts. The fi  rst part
announces Aristotle’s  project, which is to
investigate the principle of life. The term
Aristotle u s e s  h e r e  a n d  t h r o u g h o u t  i s  psukhe ˉ,
which broadly translates into En- glish as
“life-principle” or “vital principle.” This
sets the stage for Aris-totle’s own defi  nition
of psukhe ˉ, which opens part 2 of the De Anima . It 
is here that Aristotle also stratifi  es life
forms (plants, animals, humans)  according to
the type of psukhe ˉ that is manifested in them.
Part 2 goes  on to examine specifi  c aspects of
psukhe ˉ, including nutrition, movement,  an d  s
e n s a t i o n .  T hi s  c o n t in u e s  in t o  p art  3 ,  wi t h  c o mm
e n t s  o n  im a gin a -tion, cognition, and nous , a
difficult term in Greek philosophy that is of-
ten translated as “mind” or “Intellect. ” Part 3
closes with refl  ections on  movement and desire
and a summary of the work as a whole. It is thought
that the text was intended to serve as a
theoretical introduction to a more extended
lecture course on natural philosophy. 4 If the
De Anima  is thematically interstitial in
relation to Aristotle’ s  other works, it also
has an interstitial position in its complex
history of translation and interpretation.
The various translations of the De Anima   during
the Middle Ages demonstrate how translation
was indelibly bound up with interpretation,
especially in an age in which the boundary
be-tween philosophy and theology was
continually being debated. 5 Arabic 
philosophy played a pivotal role in both the
translation and interpretation of the De Anima
. From the ninth century onwards, there were at
least  two editions of the De Anima  circulating
in Arabic. One of these editions  would be used by
Ibn Sina (Avicenna) and by Ibn Rushd
(Averroës), the lat-ter producing the three
separate commentaries on the De Anima , as well 
as the compendium De Animalibus . One of
Averroës’s commentaries (the  so-called Long
Commentary) would be translated by Michael
Scotus in the thirteenth century, around the
same time that William of Moerbeke also
produced a literal, word-by-word translation
of the De Anima  from Greek  to Latin. It is this
latter edition that is used by Thomas Aquinas,
who not 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    23
    </p></div><p>
    
 8 chapter one only produces his own commentary
but several other works that attempt  to fi nd a
compromise between Greek philosophy and
Christian doctrine,  while also condemning the
heretical quasi pantheism of “Latin Averro-
ism.”6 Translation and interpretation again
go hand-in-hand when, in 1277,  the bishop of
Paris issues a series of official
Condemnations against the  Faculty of Arts at
the University of Paris. Of particular concern
is the un-derstanding of the Aristotelian
concept psukhe ˉ (as the “active” or “pas- sive”
nous , or Intellect) as being personal and
transcendently immortal, or  impersonal and
fully immanent. All of these factors make
approaching a text such as the De Anima  
exceedingly difficult. There are few texts in
the history of philosophy  that are as
complicated as this little treatise,
originally written as lecture notes, and
belonging neither to metaphysics nor physics,
neither to logic nor to biology. Nevertheless,
the De Anima  remains an important text  within
the Western philosophical tradition,
primarily because it signals one of the fi  rst,
formalized attempts to think an on tology of
life. In ad- di ti on to this, no oth er text has eli
ci ted so m uch comm en tary an d con-troversy,
from the earliest commentaries by Themistius
and Alexander of Aphrodisias, to the Medieval
heretical commentaries of Siger of Brabant, to
such modern commentaries as that of Franz
Brentano. And this points to a fi  nal
interstitiality concerning the De Anima —its
complicated recep- tion throughout antiquity
and the Middle Ages. While the De Anima  in  its
current form may not have been widely known
until the twelfth cen-tury, the basic ideas in
it were disseminated in a variety of ways. One of
these was, as we’ve mentioned, via the
translations. Another was by way of compendium
books, such as the Liber de Causis  or the
Theologia Aristo- telis. Books such as these,
long attributed to Aristotle, were
subsequently  discovered to be either an
amalgam of Aristotelianism and Neoplatonism,
or wrongly attributed altogether. 7 Thus, when
speaking about the relation- ship between
Aristotle’s De Anima  and Scholastic
philosophy, we would  do better to think broadly
about the nexus of Aristotelian, Arabic, and
Neoplatonic ideas as received by Scholastic
thinkers. Let us hazard a
term—post-Aristotelian Scholasticism—to
name all these different types of
interstitiality regarding the De Anima ,
bearing in mind that the ques- tion of
interpretation with regard to this text is
never simple or clear-cut. That said, it is
important to note that the approach to the De
Anima   presented here differs signifi  cantly
from its previous interpretations. Gen-
erally speaking, one can say that there are
three main hermeneutic tradi-tions
surrounding the De Anima . The fi  rst is that of
theology, in which  the notion of “life” is read
in terms of “soul” (in late antiquity) or
“spirit” 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    24
    </p></div><p>
    
  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 9 (in the early Christian
tradition).8 Between the eleventh and
thirteenth  centuries, the extensive
commentaries by Arabic, Jewish, and Christian 
philosophers deeply infl  uenced this
theological reading of the De Anima .  Here life
is understood as a life-spirit, the divine
spark of life that ema- nates or is manifest in
all the individual instances of living
creatures, by virtue of a sovereign and
transcendent divinity. The unfortunate
English translation of the De Anima  as “On the
Soul” still betrays the infl  uence of  this
tradition today. 9 Added to this is a second
hermeneutic tradition, that of biology. While 
natural philosophers such as Buffon noted the
importance of Aristotle for taxonomy and
classifi  cation, it is with the emergence of a
distinct disci- pline of biology, especially
after Lamarck and Darwin, that Aristotle
be-gins to be incorporated into the history of
biology. 10 Here life is understood  as
primarily natural-biological life, endowed
with a quasi-vitalistic life force that fl  ows
through each living organism. The effect of
this is seen in  twentieth-century “pop
science” books such as François Jacob’s The
Logic of Life ; current university textbooks on
the “philosophy of biology” rou- tinely begin
with a chapter on Aristotle, the “father of
biology.” Third, there is the hermeneutic
approach of psychology and cognition.  This has
become the dominant framework for reading the
De Anima  to- day, though not without some
controversy. 11 Arguably, this approach was 
inaugurated by the work of Franz Brentano,
whose The Psychology of Ar- istotle  f o r e g r o u n d 
t h e  s e c t i o n s  f r o m  t h e  De Anima  dealing with
sense  perception, emotion, and cognition.12
This post-Kantian reading of the De  Anima 
relegated the question of “life itself” to the
background, in favor of  an understanding of the
human subject and its phenomenal relation to
its environment. Interestingly , this
approach absorbs the biological
interpre-tation (in terms of the hierarchy of
life forms) into a psychological one that
remains indebted to Cartesian dualism. A great
deal of recent scholarship on the De Anima 
emphasizes this cognitivist approach. In
uncanny ways,  the debates over this
“cognitivist” Aristotle replay many of the
debates over the status of the “Intellect” in
antiquity. These hermeneutic traditions are
not chronological in relation to each  other,
and neither are they mutually exclusive.
Rather, they form three ways in which the
central philosophical question that the De
Anima   poses—the question of “life itself”—is
sublimated into a nonphilosophical domain
(theology, biology, psychology). In the
process, however, the ques-tion of philosophy
often drops out—and this strange disappearing
act is, in a way, the fundamental fi  ssure within
the De Anima itself. Our aim here  will be to
recover and to account for this disappearance
of ontology within

 10 chapter one the De Anima . Therefore, we will
be reading the De Anima  as a treatise  of
ontology, but of a particular kind—a treatise
on the ontology of life, in- sofar as “life” for
Aristotle is not simply reducible to or
synonymous with  “being.”13 Put simply, in the
De Anima  Aristotle poses a general question 
concerning the ontology of life, and the
question he poses can be put in  modern terms: T o
what extent is it possible to formulate an
ontology of life that is not reducible to
biology or sublimated within theology? The De
Anima  is, then, an approach to this basic
problematic: whether  there can be an ontology
of life that does not simply become either bio-
logical description or theological
sublimation. And let us state up front the core
of this problematic, which is this: Aristotle
must presuppose that which he sets out to
discover. In setting out to discover the
principle of life, the “is-ness” of life,
Aristotle must presume not only the category of
substance, but, more importantly, the
distinction between the living and the
nonliving. The problem is deceptively simple.
It goes something like this: Aristo- tle, in
approaching the diversity of life forms,
observes a set of character-istics unique to
what he calls life. These are described in
treatises such as the Historia Animalium , and
they are also summarized in the De Anima .  These
include life as defi  ned by its forms (life as
creative, inventive, and  productive of
different forms of life), life as defi  ned by its
temporality (life  as characterized by
movement, change, and alteration), and life as
defi  ned  by a spiritual aspect (life as that
incorporeal essence that remains the same;
life as that immaterial essence that is common
among all forms of life). In modern
terminology, we might say that life for
Aristotle is defi  ned  by form (life is the
multiplicity of forms-of-life), by time (life
is that which comes-to-be and passes-away),
and by spirit (life is that which is common to all
forms of life). In spite of—or because of—these
characteristics, Aristotle is con- fronted
with a challenge, which is to articulate a
concept that is adequate to the diversity of
what counts as “life.” Such a concept must
account for the characteristics of life (life
as time, as form, as spirit). It must account for
the conditions in which life is possible at all,
as well as for the ends of life ( entelecheia ). It
must, in Aristotle’s terms, be at once the
formal and  the fi  nal cause, and the point at
which the two overlap. But this means  that such a
concept cannot itself be a part of life, cannot
be one kind of life, or one among many instances
of life. For otherwise this simply begs the
question, in an infi  nitely deferred search for
a fi  rst principle of life.

  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 11 Thus any concept of life must
account for the principle characteristics of 
life, without itself being part of them. But in
addition to this, any concept of life must
account for life in a  way that acknowledges the
internally caused, self-animating, and self- 
organizing capacities of life. The concept of
autonomy is important for  Aristotle, both in
the De Anima  and in treatises such as the De Motu 
Animalium . The cause of life, and the condition
for life, is part and parcel  of life i tself . For
Aristotl e, i t is this self - main taining an d
self -gov erning  aspect of life (often
encompassed by the term kinesis ) that serves as
one  of the distinguishing characteristics of
the living from the nonliving. Any  concept of
life m ust be inseparab l e from actual instances
of life—whil e not being determined or limited
by them. Any concept of life cannot sim-ply be a
purely transcendental concept, one that lies
above and beyond life, for then this would go
against Aristotle’s commitment to the
inseparabil-ity of the cause of life and life
itself. This is, then, the Aristotelian
problematic: On the one hand, any con- cept of
life must be transcendent to life in order to
account for its ephem-eral nature and its
propensity for change. On the other hand, any
concept of life must be immanent to life in order
to demonstrate the inseparabil-ity between
principle and manifestation (or, in Aquinas’
terms, between essence and existence). So,
while Aristotle-the-biologist observes a set
of characteristics unique to what he calls
life, Aristotle-the-metaphysician
struggles to articulate a coherent concept to
encompass all these heteroge-neous
characteristics of life. 1.3 THE ONTOLOGY OF
LIFE How does Aristotle resolve this
problematic? In the De Anima  Aristotle 
performs two operations that are crucial for
his ontology of life. The fi  rst  is to propose a
reworking of the Greek term psukhe ˉ (yu¯chÛv)
such that it can  function as the concept of “life
itself.” As we’ve noted, the complicated
tradition of translation and commentary on the
De Anima  has resulted  in the English rendering
of the term psukhe ˉ as “soul.” However
Aristotle  certainly had in mind a nontheistic
notion of “soul.” The term psukhe ˉ is  perhaps
better translated as “vital principle” or
“principle of life, ” given the way that
Aristotle’s text straddles the domains of
philosophy, biology, and theology. M o s t  o f  b o o
k  1  o f  t h e  De Anima  i s  c o n c e rn e d  wi t h  an  o v e rvi e w  o
f   how psukhe ˉ has been used by earlier thinkers,
from Anaxagoras to Plato.

 12 chapter one For atomists psukhe ˉ is that
principle of motion and energy that makes the 
individual atoms move, collide, and bind; for
the cosmologies of Anax- agoras or Empedocles,
psukhe ˉ is a unifying principle that is
constant and  itself not subject to change; for
the Pythagoreans, psukhe ˉ is the abstract 
unity of number, a matheme or mathematical
principle governing the uni-verse. In each
case, what Aristotle extracts from prior
concepts of psukhe ˉ  is an animating principle
of the world that is not itself reduced to its own 
attributes. For Aristotle, the prior uses of
psukhe ˉ are adequate insofar as they  comment on
the dynamic properties of the natural world;
the presocratic use of psukhe ˉ successfully
accounts for movement, and in particular, the 
very capacity for movement, change, and
development that is characteris-tic of living
beings. But such theories are inadequate for
Aristotle in that they do not account for how
dynamic change or movement occurs, espe-ciall
y in th e cases o f li ving beings . Wha t is i t tha t
con di ti ons this v ery capacity for movement and
change? Life, then, becomes the standard for
understanding the dynamic and processual
aspects of the natural world. For instance, one
can simply defi  ne “life” not in terms of what it
is, but in  terms of what it does. In book 2 of the De
Anima  Aristotle notes that, of  bodies
generally, “some have life ( zw hÈn) and some
have not; by life ( zwhÌn)  we mean the capacity
for self-sustenance, growth, and decay.”14
But for Ar- istotle it is precisely this sort of
descriptive defi  nition that must itself be 
explained. Thus psukhe ˉ must not simply
describe but defi  ne, and what the  term psukhe ˉ
defi  nes is the very idea of “life itself.”
Aristotle reiterates  this equation
throughout the De Anima : The soul ( yuch Ì) is the
cause the fi  rst principle ( aΔrch Ì) of the
living body  (zwnto~ sw Èmato~ ).15 . . . for the
soul ( yuch~ ) is in a sense the principle ( aΔrch
Ì) of animal life  (zw/Èwn).16 . . . that which has
soul ( e ΔÈmyucon ) is distinguished from that
which has  not by living ( zhn).17 In these and
other passages, Aristotle arranges a number of
terms in a con-stellation with each other.
There is, of course, the principal term psukhe
ˉ,  which Aristotle equates with the concept of
life-in-itself. But this is also
distinguished from other terms denoting
“life,” such as zoeˉ, which often  implies a
biological, naturalistic understanding of
life, and bíos , which  often implies a qualifi  ed
“good” life. 18 What distinguishes psukhe ˉ as
not  just meaning “life” but specifi  cally a
“principle-of-life” is the term Ar- ±±±

  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 13 istotle uses again and again,
arche ˉ. This is the key to Aristotle’s “raising 
up” of the term psukhe ˉ to an ontological
principle, the arche ˉ of life, the 
life-principle. In short, Aristotle takes up
the way that the concept of psukhe ˉ explains 
that life is and how  it is, but he also makes the
term account for what  life  is. Aristotle raises
up this term to mean not simply the facticity of
living  beings, but that by which such a
facticity of life is possible. If the
problem-atic that Aristotle confronts is how
to articulate under a single concept the
diversity of life, here we see in the concept of
psukhe ˉ an attempt to  account for not just this
or that particular living being, but for “life
itself.” For Aristotle, psukhe ˉ is the arche ˉ
of zoe ˉ and  bíos ; it is the principle of life,  or
the life that is common across every instance of
life—even, and espe-cially if this principle
remains empty or unexamined . Aristotle’s
reworking of the concept of psukhe ˉ allows him
to do a num- ber  o f  things  con cep tuall y .  Firs t , 
th e  raising - u p  o f  psukhe ˉ as a principle  means
that any ontology of life will have to
articulate a principle-of-life ,  or that which
is the essence of life. But, as we’ve seen, this
essence is often defi ned in terms of something
other than life—life defi  ned in terms of  time,
form, or spirit. Additionally, the
principle-of-life makes possible a number of
distinctions, the most prominent one being
that between the living and the nonliving.
These distinctions serve to establish the
cate-gories and boundaries through which one
may account for life in terms of species,
genera, and so on. We can call these boundaries
of articula- tion. Finally, these two aspects—
psukhe ˉ as a principle, and the boundary 
between the living and nonliving—enable
Aristotle to employ a range of concepts in the
analysis of life forms. These include the
familiar Aristo-telian pairs of form/matter
and actual/potential, as well as the important
concept of fi  nality or entelechy. These serve
as the governing motifs  of the  ontology of life,
the logical terms that govern any analysis of
life. However, this Aristotelian ontology of
life opens onto a further prob- lematic
regarding the status of psukhe ˉ as a concept.
From one perspective,  psukhe ˉ is that which
conditions change and which itself does not
change;  a principle of life that is itself not
life. But psukhe ˉ also cannot be totally 
separate from the actualization of change, or
towards that to which it tends—its purpose, its
fi  nality, its goal or aim. Here, in a much-
referenced  passage, Aristotle will use the
analogy of the eye: “If the eye were a living
creature ( zw/on), its soul ( yuch Ì) would be its
vision; for this is the substance  in the sense of
the formula of the eye.”19 This in turn implies
that psukhe ˉ  is never present in itself, apart
from its manifestation in the various forms of
life. Aristotle continues with the analogy:
“just as a pupil and the fac- ±

 14 chapter one ulty of seeing make an eye, so in
the other case the soul and body make  a living
creature. It is quite clear, then, that neither
the soul nor certain parts of it, if it has parts,
can be separated from the body.” 20 While
Aristotle’s concept of psukhe ˉ enables him to
unfold an entire  o n t o l o g y  a r o u n d  “ l i f e ”  a s  a  p r i
n c i p l e - o f - l i f e ,  w i t h  i t s  b o u n d a r i e s  o f  a r
-ticulation and governing motifs, there still
remains the basic problem of the relation
between psukhe ˉ as this “ life- in- i tself” and
psukhe ˉ as mani- fested concretely in
physical, biological, living beings. At times
Aristo-tle discusses psukhe ˉ as if it were a
purely abstract, ideational concept, a 
concept belonging more to the Metaphysica  than
to the De Anima . At  other  moments—as with his
numerous biological analogies—the concept  of
psukhe ˉ is un ders tood to be inseparab l e from
parti cular li ving beings ,  something inherent
within them. While psukhe ˉ functions well as a
prin- ciple, the problem that remains for
Aristotle is this ambiguous relation 
between—or indeed within—the concept of
psukhe ˉ itself. Aristotle’s concept of psukhe
ˉ must perform contradictory functions—it 
must account for life without itself being
life, and yet it cannot be separate from life. It
must be at once external and internal to life.
How does Aristo-tle smooth over this
contradiction? The clearest statement comes
in the opening passages of book 1 of the  De Anima ,
part of which we have cited earlier, and which we
can now  quote at length: The knowledge of the
soul ( yuch ~ ) admittedly contributes greatly
to  the advance of truth in general, and, above
all, to our understanding of  Nature, for the
soul is in some sense the principle of animal
life ( zw/Èwn).  Our aim is to grasp and
understand, fi  rst its essential nature ( ou Δsi
Èan),  and secondly its properties; of these
some are thought to be affections  proper to the
soul itself ( yuch ~ ), while others are
considered to attach  to the animal ( zw/Èoi~)
owing to the presence within it of soul.21 Here,
at the outset of the treatise, Aristotle is
laying bare his aim. But  in so doing he is also
setting out the parameters for what an ontology
of life can possibly mean. He sets out to inquire
into what psukhe ˉ is. Why?  Because psukhe ˉ is
the principle ( arche ˉ) of all living beings.
Thus psukhe ˉ is  the principle-of-life. But how
and in what way is psukhe ˉ a principle of life? 
Again Aristotle’s original problematic
returns, though he is in many ways never far from
the forests and fi  elds, and the fl  ora and fauna
of Mytilene or  Stagira. We look around and bear
witness to all the diverse and particular  ±±

  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 15 instances of life; how can there
be a concept to encompass everything that  is
life? Aristotle’s reply is that a single
principle of life can encompass all the  parti
cular ins tan ces of life onl y if tha t con cept is i
tself in ternall y sp li t ,  and that split will be
between psukhe ˉ as a life-principle and psukhe
ˉ as a  manifestation in living beings. This is a
delicate distinction within the De  Anima
—truthfully, it never quite holds, even though
Aristotle states it  at the outset. But it is also
a crucial move, for it allows Aristotle to think 
both a concept of life-in-itself, not tethered
to this or that particular in-stance of life, as
well as a concept of life that is immanent with
respect to its manifold variations and
manifestations. But this internal split is not
simply a split between an abstract Idea  and its
attendant, accidental characteristics.
There is no universal model or mold called
psukhe ˉ, which then takes on derivative forms
as it is incar- nated in the world. For, as
Aristotle notes, there is no thing called
“life-in- itself” that is ever present apart
from its formal, dynamic, and temporal
instantiations in the variety of living
beings. And yet, Aristotle does not dispense
with the arche ˉ-of-life altogether. He seems
to imply its necessary  existence if one is to
think something like “life” at all. How, then,
should one characterize the internal split
within psukhe ˉ  that Aristotle puts forth?
Quite simply, Aristotle utilizes
metaphysical concepts to describe an in ternal
differen tia ti on wi thin psukhe ˉ. There is  a fi
rst aspect of psukhe ˉ, the essence or the
“being” of life, as it were—the  ousia  of psukhe
ˉ. Here one is considering not this or that
particular living  being, b u t tha t aspect of
life tha t cu ts across all parti cular ins tan ces
of life. Then there is a second aspect of psukhe
ˉ, or those attributes that may  vary or change,
without affecting the principle-of-life
itself. In the case of an animal, the fi  rst
notion of psukhe ˉ would be that which it has in
com- mon with any other living being, that by
virtue of which it is living, while the second
notion of psukhe ˉ would be all those attributes
that constitute  the variables of this
particular animal—e.g., the variables that
delineate one species from another. Thus, to
use an example from the Historia Ani-malium , a
giant squid is a living being in the same
substantial sense that  a human being is living,
though there are of course numerous
differences between them. These differences
can be partially attributed to the fi  rst  sense
of being alive—that is, the way in which psukhe ˉ
as a principle is in- stantiated in a living
form—and partially attributed to variations
between two or more living beings of the same
kind (e.g., the number of tentacles,
coloration, spotted marks of one squid versus
another). It is this partiality—refl  ected in
the citation above—that distinguishes

 16 chapter one Aristotle’s ontology of life
from being ontology pure and simple. Aristot-
le’s familiar metaphysical pair of
substance-accident does not quite apply to
these two notions of psukhe ˉ; in fact, they are
contained within the sec- ond notion of psukhe
ˉ, as both the substance of this singular living
being,  and the set of accidental attributes of
that living being. It is also not like the
Neoplatonic “One,” a reservoir of energy or
spirit that then descends, via a divine gift,
into the receptacles or husks of living beings.
Though it can be distinguished in concept, the
ousia  of psukhe ˉ cannot be separated  in the
manifestation of the living itself. This means
that, while the very idea of psukhe ˉ as
principle may be  necessary for Aristotle in
order to think “life” at all, it appears to be un-
thinkable except in its manifestations. On the
one hand, the ousia  of  psukhe ˉ can never be
thought in itself, since psukhe ˉ is never
present as one  living being among other living
beings. But on the other hand, psukhe ˉ in  its
ousia  is also never exhausted in this or that
particular instance of a liv- ing being.
Insofar as psukhe ˉ exists only in particular
instantiations, it also  moves outside the
individuated living being, always
cutting-across and ex-teriorizing the living
being. How, then, can psukhe ˉ be isolated or
distinguished at all? Not by vir- tue of any
intrinsic characteristics “in” the living
being, for then psukhe ˉ  would simply be one
among many (accidental) attributes. Perhaps
it is not the intrinsic attributes that point to
a principle of life, but instead the ex-trinsic
vectors by which psukhe ˉ cuts across all
instances of life. If this  is the case, then the
distinguishing mark of psukhe ˉ would be this
capac- ity for always exteriorizing, always
cutting-across, always transposing and
transforming between one form and another.
Aristotle hints at such an explanation in book 2
of the De Anima ,  when he explains that there is
not one, homogenous psukhe ˉ for all living 
beings, but several types of psukhe ˉ that are
specifi  c to their functions or  their ends—a
nutritive psukhe ˉ, dealing with growth and
decay, a sensory  and motile psukhe ˉ, dealing
with “movement” in the broadest sense, from 
physical motion to sensation and affection,
and fi  nally a rational and ide- ational psukhe
ˉ, that deals with thought and spirit. This
capacity for cutting-across—which really
implies a principle of  immanence—is
immediately recuperated within more vertical
stratifi  - ca ti on of life forms. In Aristotl e’ s
form ula ti on, th e extrinsi c capaci ty of psukhe
ˉ to cut across instances of life is rendered in a
highly stratifi  ed and  hierarchical manner, in
an ascending order of complexity.
Furthermore, if the uniqueness of psukhe ˉ lies
in its capacity for cutting across living 
forms, then this would seem to work against a
more restricted notion of

  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 17 psukhe ˉ that relies on intrinsic
properties and the stable boundary that de- fi 
nes the living being in its living. In short,
Aristotle bifurcates the concept of psukhe ˉ
into psukhe ˉ-as- principle and psukhe
ˉ-as-manifestation. Put in different terms,
we can say  that Aristotle splits his ontology of
life into that-by-which-the-living-is-
living  and that-which-is-living . We can
choose less verbose terms, and  summarize by
saying that Aristotle’s ontology of life
depends on a split  within the central concept of
psukhe ˉ, and that split is one between Life  and
the living . Here let us insert a terminological
clarifi  cation. Throughout this book,  the word
“life” will be used to denote the general
presumptions  about life,  be it in terms of
biology (the organism), philosophy
(existential, ethico-political, or
otherwise), or humanism (theories of the
subject and its privi-leged phenomenality).
We will use the terms “Life” and “the living” to
denote two interrelated presuppositions 
about life: “Life” as this idea of  that which
grounds and can be manifested only in its
particular instances, and “the living” to
denote those manifestations or particular
instances. Certainly, the presuppositions
rely a great deal on a more general, fuzzy back
drop of presumpti ons ( e. g. , tha t “ life ” is th
ere “ for us ” ) . Bu t, in our subsequent
discussions, we will also be looking for those
moments when the presuppositions turn back on,
and even negate, the presumptions
alto-gether. This will have, as one effect, a
more radical questioning of the con-cept of
“life” itself, and the degree to which it can be
adequately thought within a philosophical
framework. In the De Anima , Aristotle
bifurcates life between a quasi- ontological 
notion of Life and a naturalistic notion of the
living. Here “Life” is the concept of
life-in-itself, the life of the living, the
abstract notion of life, while “the living” are
any and all the instances of life, the
manifestations of life, in some cases even the
naturalistic, organismic, and biologistic
notions of life. Life is that through  which the
heterogeneous domains of  the living are alive;
Life is that by which the heterogeneous domains
of  the living can be said to be alive.
Aristotle’s ontology of life sets out to
address both the concept of life and its
manifestations; the term psukhe ˉ  signifi  es
that which is held in common among all the
living, while the  internal  distinction
between Life and the living accommodates
stratifi  ca- tions within life. I t  i s  thi s  b ifur
ca ti o n  tha t  s e rv es  as  th e  p la tf o rm  f o r  s u b s eq u e
n t  d e b a t es   between, for example, mechanism and
vitalism. As Georges Canguilhem notes, for
there to be a debate over life in itself, there
must be a certain

 18 chapter one “vitalist exigency,” a minimal
difference between Life and the living.  Thus,
“vitalism translates a permanent exigency of
life in the living, the self-identity of life
immanent to the living.” 22 This in turn also
requires  tha t  Lif e  main tain  a  certain  con cep
tual  n e b ul o usn ess  in  re la ti on  to  th e   living—it
is the horizon of what can be thought of Life, by
the living. This means that the vitalist
exigency cannot remain at the level of  the
philosophy of biology , if it is to inquire into
“life” as an ontological category. In this way,
the Aristotelian split between Life and the
living also evokes another conceptual
pair—that of the ontological difference
between Being and beings highlighted by
Heidegger. This distinction is crucial for
Heidegger, as it comes to form the basis for any
ontological query at all. Heidegger’s lecture
courses often turn to Aristotle in talking not
only about ontological difference, but the
pulling-apart of metaphys-ics from physics (
phusis ) .  As  h e  n o t es ,  i t  i s  thi s  l a t t e r  t e rm 
phusis  that  encompasses not only “nature,” but
a whole host of questions for Aristotle
concerning the ontology of life: “Questions
are asked concerning what life itself is, what
the soul is, what arising and passing away are . .
. what the emptiness is in which that which moved
moves, what that which moves itself is as a whole
and what the Prime Mover is.” 23 The obvious
question here is whether the Aristotelian
Life-living split  is simply a variant on the
Heideggerian one between Being and beings.
This is a complicated question, to be sure,
especially since it invites us to exam-ine in
greater depth the infl  uence of Aristotle on the
early Heidegger. Inter-estingly, Heidegger
argues that this broad usage of phusis
—covering as it  does “life itself” as well as
modality, movement, and causality—undergoes
a pulling-apart process in Aristotle, in which
physics, as the Being of be-ings, detaches
itself from metaphysics, as Being in itself:
“We thereby have two meanings of fu Èsi~ [phusis
] that are found together in  Aristotelian 
philosophy: fi  rstly fuÈsi~ [phusis ] as beings
as a whole, and secondly fuÈsi~  [phusis ] in the
sense of ou Δsi Èa [ousia ], the essentiality of
beings as such.” 24 For our purposes here, let us
note a few things. First, for Heidegger, the 
question of Being (and beings) always
supersedes the question of Life (and the
living), just as the disciplines of biology,
psychology, and anthropology must presuppose
a more basic set of ontological commitments
concern-ing the existence of their objects of
study. A philosophy of life that can-not
question the being of life runs in circles (it
is, for Heidegger, no more helpful than saying
“the botany of plants”). “What strikes us fi  rst
of all  in such a philosophy (and this is its
fundamental lack) is that ‘life’ itself as a
kind of being does not become a problem
ontologically.” 25 So if the  Life-living split
is a variant of ontological difference, this is
less because 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 19 it is retroactively derived from
Heidegger, and more because it is a part of 
Aristotle’s metaphysical system itself. In
books Gamma and Delta of the Metaphysica ,
Aristotle is relatively clear on the question
of being in itself  and its distinction from
particular instances or types of beings. What
is  lacking, of course, is a privileging of the
phenomenal life-world of the sub-ject as the
ground, or, in Heidegger’s term, the
“wavering” between these two senses of being.
Another, more important point, is that it is not
at all clear in the De  Anima  whether the question
of “life” is an ontological one. In other words, 
while the Being-beings distinction is a
question concerning fundamental ontology for
Heidegger, and while the same basic
distinction is also found in Aristotle’s
metaphysical works, it remains unclear
whether the Life-living distinction is an
ontological distinction. This is both a source
of frustration and interest in the De Anima . In
the opening passages of the  treatise,
Aristotle, as if to express his uncertainty
about this topic, throws nearly every
metaphysical term into the text—the question
of life is dis-cussed in terms of substance and
accident, the actual and the potential, formal
and fi  nal cause, defi  nition and number, and so
on. The real ques- tion for Aristotle—one that
he admits in the opening and closing sections of
the De Anima —is what kind of a thing “life” is for
thought. Should it  be considered as an object of
metaphysical speculation, empirical verifi 
ca- tion, or subjective phenomenality? The De
Anima  contains bits of each of  these, with
“life” being discussed in terms of geometrical
systematicity, in terms of natural
philosophy, and in terms of affect,
imagination, and cognition. This uncertainty
is arguably what separates the Life-living
distinction  from that of ontological
difference. Aristotle remains fuzzy about the
de-gree to which the question of “life” is
reducible to the question of “be-ing.” For
Heidegger, this is not a question at all, since
there is no more fundamental question than that
of being, and no more basic distinction than
that between Being and beings. Heidegger is
clear on what ontologi-cal difference
entails: “The being of beings ‘is’ itself not a
being.” 26 Fur- thermore, this very
distinction, for Heidegger, points to a
special kind of being (a “being-there” or
Dasein ), one that inculcates a certain
priority to  the human being: “Da-sein is a being
that does not simply occur among other beings.
Rather it is ontically distinguished by the
fact that in its being this being is concerned
about  its very being . . . The ontic distinc- tion
of Da-sein lies in the fact that it is
ontological.” 27 What is at stake for  this
distinction between Being and beings is the way
that the specifi  cally  human being hovers
between these two terms: “We consider beings as
a 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    35
    </p></div><p>
    
 20 chapter one whole, and thereby think being.
Thus, in thinking, we move within the 
differentiation between beings and being.”28
Aristotle’s fuzziness vis-à-vis the question
of life remains interesting,  however. For, on
the one hand, Aristotle appears to simply apply
metaphys- ical concepts to the question of
life, implying—contra Heidegger—that the
latter can in fact be adequately thought in
terms of, and subordinate to, the question of
being. On the other hand, Aristotle repeatedly
makes attempts to carve out a niche for the
question of life that is not reducible to that of
pure metaphysics or to any branch thereof. Yet,
what it is exactly that makes the question of
life unique proves to be elusive in the De Anima . 
Aristotle sometimes settles on a kind of fi  nal
causality specifi  c to living  beings,
entelecheia . But even this turns in on itself,
since what makes  “ life” unique is en tel ech y ,
and en tel ech y is simp ly defi  ned as the mani-
festation of fi  nal causality in living beings.
At other moments, Aristotle  appears to accord
human consciousness—as a particular
manifestation of nous or “Intellect”—a
special place as that which makes life distinct
from being. But this runs into the problem of
confusing the exemplar with the ideal form—the
life-principle psukhe ˉ does double-duty, at
once the most  basic and fundamental aspect of
life, and also the most developed or high-est
form of life. In short, Aristotle sets out for
himself—and for nearly all ontologies of life
that follow—a tautological problem: the De
Anima  at- tempts to articulate that which makes
the question of life distinct from the question
of being, but this can only be done through the
framework of being. The concept of psukhe ˉ—as
that which distinguishes life from   being—is
also that which ontologically  distinguishes
life from being. So crucial is this move that it
can be said to be equivalent to the very 
possibility of an ontology of life itself.
Aristotle’s original problematic is how to
articulate a concept of life that accounts for
its plasticity—that is, “life” in terms of
time, form, and spirit. His solution is to
develop a con-cept of a principle-of-life,
encapsulated in the term psukhe ˉ. But then this 
requires a presupposition between something
called life-in-itself and the various and
manifold instances of life. The problematic
then becomes that of explaining the
relationship between these two, between
life-in-itself and the manifestations of
life. Certainly, this raises more questions
than it answers. The principle-of- life (
psukhe ˉ) and the boundary-of-articulation
(Life and the living) appear  to at once provide a
ground for an ontology of life, while also
dissolving the concept altogether. To this
end, the De Anima  presents the concept of  psukhe
ˉ as an always-receding horizon that is never
present to thought in  itself. It is as if, in
proposing a concept of the principle-of-life (
psukhe ˉ), Ar-

  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 21 istotle is forced to think “life”
in terms other-than-life (time and tempo-
rality, form and causality, spirit and
transcendence). In the process, these
other-than-life terms eventually come to
displace and efface the principle-of-life
altogether. There is a sense in the De Anima  that
what remains of  “life” is this strange animate
nothingness, a kind of vitalist void in which
the principle-of-life can assert itself only
via that which displaces it. In Aristotle’s De
Anima , the life-principle psukhe ˉ is at once
ontologically  necessary and yet that which
cannot be thought in itself. Even a cursory
examination of this ontology reveals what
appear to be  a number of contradictions, a few of
which we can list here. To begin with,  while we
can point to numerous instances of the living,
Life, in itself, is never existent as such. The
only “evidence” of Life is precisely its
mani-festation in and as the living; Life, or
that which conditions the living, is in itself
nonexistent. As we will see, following this
line of thought leads either to an aporia that
nevertheless grounds the concept of “life,” or
to the acceptance of a negative theology at the
heart of the ontology of life. If Life, as that
which grounds the living, is never present in
itself, then  this opens onto another
contradiction: What is common among the living
is Life, but Life in itself has no properties,
attributes, or characteristics. Thus, what is
held in common among the living is itself
nothing in partic-ular. While the living is
manifested as discrete, “full” presence, Life
itself is never manifested, and can be thought
only as a continuum of absence, or void; while
Life is empty, the living is full; and this empty
principle therefore grounds the surplus of its
manifestations. If this is the case, then we are
led to yet another contradiction. While  the
living is characterized by production,
growth, and development, Life, never being
present, is void of any content, biological or
otherwise. If the previous
contradiction—Life as common among the
living—is one grounded in a spatialized
relation, then in this contradiction—Life as
static basis for the living as
dynamic—involves a temporal one. The prob-lem
here becomes how to correlate a static,
fundamental concept with a dynamic, regional
one. Although these contradictions appear to
point to an incommensurabil- ity between Life
and the living, it is important to note that, for
Aristotle, Life and the living form an
indissociable pair. And this is also a fi  nal
con- tradiction that we can mention, one that
encapsulates the previous ones: One cannot
think Life without thinking the living; one
cannot think Life while at the same time
thinking the living . While Aristotle makes a
dis- tinction between Life and the living, he is
careful to avoid implying that they are
autonomous and separate terms. But, as we’ve
seen, these two 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    37
    </p></div><p>
    
 22 chapter one terms point to a number of
contradictions, such that it becomes
difficult  to think their relation at all . . .
except in terms of contradiction. It would be
tempting, in this situation, to simply throw
out the Aristo- telian ontology of life
altogether. One could easily dismiss it as
outmoded  and anachronistic, especially in an
era of advanced technoscience, when th e  q u es ti
o n  o f  lif e  i ts e lf  is  disp ar ag ed  as  m e r e  m e ta p h y s
i cs .  On e  co ul d  also recuperate the De Anima 
within a fairly linear continuum, and call  it
the “history of biology” or even the
“philosophy of biology.” In this case 
Aristotle would be extended and corrected by
Descartes, Buffon, Linnaeus, Darwin, and
molecular biology (“Aristotle, the father of
biology . . . ”). In either case, Aristotle and
his ontology of life would appear as outmoded or
as the point of origin. We can suggest another
approach, which involves neither dismissing 
nor recuperating Aristotle, and that is to
highlight the De Anima  as pre- senting an
ontology of life, and not simply a theology or a
biology, in spite  of—or because of—its
contradictions. This, as we’ve seen, points to
the two moves that Aristotle makes—the concept
of psukhe ˉ and the bifurca- tion between Life
and the living. Let us neither ignore nor try to
resolve the apparent contradictions at the
heart of the De Anima , and instead pre- serve
them as that which makes such an ontology
possible, and that which  ultimately
undermines it. What would this entail? To begin
with, it would mean thinking about  the more
general relationships between logic and life
that Aristotle’s De  Anima  only begins to
outline. Such a thought would not simply be that
of  a commensurability between them (e.g., that
life is ordered and thus logi- cal), but rather
of a basic incommensurability between them, a
kind of  vi- talist incommensurability between
logic and life. Note that this does not simply
mean that life is inaccessible to logic, or that
the former always re-mains mysteriously out of
reach of the latter. It means, instead, that a
dif-ferent kind of logic—that of
contradiction and its own logical  coherency—
may serve as the ground for the Aristotelian
concept of psukhe ˉ. As we will  see in the
subsequent sections of this book, accepting
this means rethink-ing not only the relation
between thought and life, but the notion that
thought is life. 1.4 THE ENTELECHY OF THE WEIRD
To get a sense of what this may mean, let us return
briefl  y to Lovecraft’s  third type of life—the
nameless living thing (the Shoggoths, the
Elder Things, or the vague and ominous
creatures that inhabit William Hope 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    38
    </p></div><p>
    
  life and the living (on aristotelian
biohorror) 23 Hodgson’s Night Land  . . .). This
third type of life is different both from  that of
the profane world of human beings, and from that
of the ancient,  alien world of the “Old Ones.”
But this third type of life is not simply that of
the “monster,” at least in any traditional
sense. The monster is a crea-ture of norm and law
, a form of life that is defi  ned by its deviation
from  a norm, its aberration in the order of
things, and its transgression of the  law.
Monsters are also often produced, or are
by-products, of this norm or law—be it in terms
of a divine Book of Nature, or in terms of the mad
scientist playing God. Monsters are always
monstrum , that which dem- onstrates, which
testifi  es, and which inadvertently affirms
the biological  norm or political law. The third
type of life form described in Lovecraft’s
stories is not a mon- ster in this traditional
sense. The Shoggoths or Elder Things do not even 
share the same reality with the human beings who
encounter them—and yet this encounter takes
place, though in a strange no-place that is
neither quite that of the phenomenal world of
the human subject or the noumenal world of an
external reality. Lovecraft’s characters
search for an adequate set of concepts to
describe them but ultimately fail—they have
material bodies, but not materiality “as we
know it”; they have “intermittent lapses of
visibility”; they can manifest themselves in
our world and yet they have no fi xed form. In
Lovecraft’s stories the Shoggoths can barely
be named, let alone ad- equately described or
thought . And this is the crux of supernatural
hor- ror, the reason why life is “weird.” The
threat is not the monster, or that  which
threatens existing categories of knowledge.
Rather, it is the “name-less thing,” or that
which presents itself as a horizon for thought.
If the monster is that which cannot be
controlled ( the unlawful life), then the
nameless thing is that which cannot be thought
(the unthinkable life). Why can it not be
thought? Not because it is something unknown or
not-yet known (the mystical or the scientifi 
c). Rather, it is because it presents  the
possibility of a logic of life, though an
inaccessible logic, one that is absolutely
inaccessible to the human, the natural, the
earthly—an “en-telechy of the weird.” This is,
perhaps, one defi  nition of what Lovecraft and
other writers re- fer to as “the weird.” For
Lovecraft, the weird is not the discovery of an
ab-erration, which would place us in the
context of law, norm, and the mon-ster. Rather,
the weird is the discovery of an unhuman limit to
thought, that is nevertheless foundational
for thought. The life that is weird is the life
according to the logic of an inaccessible real,
a life “out of space and time,” and life of
“extra-dimensional biologies.” However this
does not

 24 chapter one mean that life remains mystical
and ineffable; life cannot be thought, not 
because it is poetry, the sublime, or even the
noumenal. Rather, life can- not be thought
because it can only be thought through a logic of
contradic-tion, and contradiction is—as
Aristotle reminds us—the very bedrock of
rational thought itself. Perhaps, if
supernatural horror is the paradigm for
thinking “life” to- day, it is less because of
the way it situates life vis-à-vis the monster
and  the law or norm, and more because it raises
the question of logic, life, and the “weird”
relation between the two. Let us restate this
idea: supernatu-ral horror provides us with
the model for thinking about the Aristotelian
ontology of life in terms of its ontologically
necessary contradictions. We can, not without
a bit of humor (since there is always humor, if
not the ab-surd, in the weird), refer to this
monstrous coupling of logic and bio-logic as
“Aristotelian biohorror.” From the framework
laid out in the De Anima  one inherits not only a 
set of concepts, but the contradictions that
necessarily follow upon them. This is not just a
problem of philosophy—in which life is an
object of in- quiry for, say, the philosophy of
biology. What results is also a problem for
philosophy. Aristotle utilizes metaphysical
concepts to describe an  internal
differentiation within psukhe ˉ. There is the
“being” of life, as it  were—the ousia  of psukhe
ˉ. But this also presupposes an ontology of life 
that is not simply identical to ontology per se.
This involves the basic pre- supposition that
every ontology of life presumes a primary
distinction be-tween life and being—but only
insofar as it can think of life only in terms of
being. The principle-of-life ( psukhe ˉ) and
the boundary-of-articulation (Life vs.  the
living) appear to at once provide not only a
ground for an ontology of life, but also the
ground for dissolving the concept altogether.
To this end, the De Anima  presents the concept of
psukhe ˉ as an always-receding  horizon—on
further examination, “life” simply becomes
isomorphic with t im e  an d  t e m p o r ali ty ,  wi th  f o
rm  an d  c a u s ali ty ,  o r  wi th  s p iri t  an d  t r an
-scendence. In the De Anima , the
life-principle psukhe ˉ is at once ontologi-
cally necessary and yet that which cannot be
thought in itself, and the De  Anima  is, early on,
already insinuating the necessary and yet
unexam- ined void at the heart of philosophical
questioning of life: To what extent are all
ontologies of life determined within the
twofold framework of the  principle-of-life
and the bifurcation between Life and the
living? 29

 25Negations are true and affirmations are
inadequate. —Nicholas of Cusa 2.1 LIFE WITH OR
WITHOUT LIMITS We begin this chapter with a
broad question: To what extent is an  ontology of
life possible? When one looks at the concept of
life in  Western philosophy, one sees a
duplicity in nearly every attempt to think life
itself. In one line of thinking, life appears to
be defi  ned by limit—life  as defi  ned by that
which exists in time, and, as such, is subject to
fi  nitude  and temporality. Indeed, life is
precisely this fi  nitude, the constraints of 
corporeality, and the limitations of
temporality. Aristotle, for instance,
dedicates an entire treatise— De Generatione
et Corruptione —to this idea,  describing the
dual processes of “coming-to-be” and
“passing-away” as central to the Life of the
living. And such constraints apply not only to
the individuated living being, but to groups of
living beings—hence the idea of extinction
doubly haunts every instance of the living, as
an individualized living being and as a
generalized type or form of life. 1 So fi  nite are
life-  processes that Descartes could, using a
notorious analogy, describe the  living being
as a clockwork mechanism, reducible to its
component parts and their discrete
interactions. But such an orientation is not
limited to vitalistic or mechanistic
theories. In the Romantic and
Lebensphilosophie   traditions, this fi  nitude
of life (birth/death, growth/decay) is not
denied  but affirmed, culminating in an
organicist philosophy of dynamic change and
becoming. Here is Schelling: “So long as I
myself am identical  with  Nature, I understand
what a living nature is as well as I understand my
own life . . . As soon, however, as I separate
myself, and with me every-chapter two

 26 chapter two thing ideal, from Nature,
nothing remains to me but a dead object, and I 
cease to comprehend how a life outside me can be
possible.”2 At its limit, the notion of
life-as-fi  nitude turns into its
opposite—death,  d e c a y ,  a n d  d e c o m p o s i t i o n .  I n 
e i g h t e e n t h - c e n t u r y  p a t h o l o g i c a l  a n a t o m y ,  
life is seen to be working even in the “vital”
processes of tissue decay and the decomposing
corpse—the “vital properties” are thus
distinguished from the merely “physical
properties” by “contractibility,”
“sensibility,” and other attributes. 3 The
phenomena of putrefaction and fermentation 
serve as laboratories for thinking about a kind
of necrological vitalism in eighteenth- and
nineteenth-century German biology. In a way,
biological vitalism begins to overlap with
philosophical vitalism. Schelling again:
“Life-activity is the cause of its own
extinction . . . and so life itself is only the
bridge to death.” 4 Life-processes, thought of
in terms of fi  nitude, begin  to turn into their
opposite, death-processes. At the same time,
however, it is precisely this emphasis on
process that  reveals another line of thinking
about life, one in which life is associated not
so much with the fi  nite, but with the infi  nite.
The infi  nite is under- stood here not in the
mathematical sense, but rather in terms of
duration and continuity. It is precisely
because life exists in time, but is not fi  xed in 
time, that it is infi  nite. While the discrete
living organism lives and dies,  life itself is a
continuum that conditions the possibility of
the living. No doubt there are infl  uences of
Neoplatonism in this regard (as we will see 
below); but the notion of life as fl  ow, fl  ux, and
process is not only a key  feature of Darwinian
biology, but it is also at the center of
early-twentieth-century attempts to think
life in a nonreductionist way, be it in the
pro-cess philosophy of Bergson or Whitehead,
the process theology of Chardin, or the renewed
“scientifi  c” vitalism of Driesch. In the
History and Theory  of Vitalism , Driesch had
identifi  ed the “autonomy of the processes of
life”  as central to any philosophical inquiry
into life. Driesch would also bring back a
concept posited by Aristotle and redefi  ned by
Kant: entelechy, or  the immaterial guiding
force of life-processes towards particular
ends. Thus, from a general point of view, life is
at once fi  nite and infi  nite,  closed and open,
discrete and continuous. In many instances the
view of life in terms of fi  nitude eventually
opens onto the view of life as infi  nite. 
Whatever the case, there is a general tendency
to characterize life itself in some opposition
to limit, at the same time that life is defi  ned in
terms of  temporality as a kind of
de-limitation. We can broadly refer to this
dual move as “philosophical vitalism.” What is
required of vitalism as a philosophical
gesture? First, life must  be characterized as
something that is generous, productive,
proliferative, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    42
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 27 and germinal. Life is that
which fl  ows or pours forth—whether one posits  a 
transcen den t  so urce  o f  tha t  fl  owing, or
whether life-as-process simply  fl ows from
itself. This implies a second requirement,
which is that the  generosity of life is itself
irreducible and unlimited, though the
particular  manifestations of life may in and of
themselves be constrained. Whether one posits
a “life-force,” “All-Soul,” élan vital , or
emergent properties,  there is something, some
Life, that conditions the possibility of the
con-ditioned, or the living—even if this
conditioning principle is itself fully
immanent within the conditioned. This means
that, in addition to it be-ing generous and
conditioning, life in philosophical vitalism
must fulfi  ll  a third requirement, which is that
it be distributive, pervasive, and out- fl
owing. This means that life for philosophical
vitalism is at once every- where and nowhere, a
pure excess and generosity, and yet in itself
not any  one, single, individual instance of
life. For philosophical vitalism, a number of
questions arise from these re- quirements. For
example, if life is understood as generosity
and excess, as  something that never “runs out,”
from what reservoir does it derive this
generosity, this propensity? This question
leads to others: Must one pre-suppose a
transcendent principle-of-life, from which
it derives its  excess— a kind of divine
reservoir of life? If not, then how can the
concept of life be  thought at all, without some
externally conditioning principle or
criterion by which we can think of something as
alive? Is a principle-of-life some-thing that
is ontologically necessary for thinking the
concept of life in philosophical vitalism? If
not, how then does one account for the
dialec-tics of identity and difference, or
being and becoming vis-à-vis this notion of
life as fl  ux and fl  ow? This is the central
problematic that will occupy us here: Life
under- stood in terms of time. Life is
understood not only as that which exists in 
time, but this existing-in-time brings with it
a host of questions, questions concerning
change and stasis, life-as-productive and
life-as- destructive,  the reduction of life to
nonliving substance (the chemistry of life,
the physics of life) and the raising-up of life
to phenomenological or even mys-tical levels
(the phenomenon of life, spiritual life). All
of this points to a problematic outlined by
Aristotle—the rela- tion between Life and the
living, and the way in which both are inscribed
in time. For Aristotle, both the particular
species of the living, as well as the
life-principle ( psukhe ˉ), are often
discussed in terms of temporal- ity, change,
and movement. Time also becomes a concern in the
many debates concerning mechanism and
vitalism, whether time be reversible or not,
whether the temporality of the organism be
different from that of

 28 chapter two the nonliving. Arguably,
contemporary interest in emergence and self-
organization takes up the issue of time as well,
but, instead of relying on an external
organizing principle (divine order or natural
law), such re-search asks how the living
dynamically organizes itself internally,
from within its own local contingencies. In
short, how can one account for the dynamic
production and creation of the living, once one
subtracts a tran-scendent principle, once one
subtracts an Artifi  cer or Creator? Thus, our
guiding question—can there be an ontology of
life that does  not become a biology or theology
of life?—will take us in a direction that,  at fi
rst, may seem counterintuitive. Instead of
marching through the his- tory of biology, we
will consider a few specifi  c moments in
Medieval phi- losophy, by way of Neoplatonism
and mystical theology. But if we are not to
reduce life to biology , equally must we not
reduce it to theology . Phi-losophy provides a
middle path here, though, as we will see, it
opens onto its own set of problems as well. Our
guiding question will serve to set up a number of
attributes by which we can delineate the
contours and limits of life as an ontological
question. One of those attributes will be the
idea of life thought of in terms of time: as
generosity, as proliferation, as excess— an
idea that we will call superlative life .
Tracing the develop- ment of superlative life
will take us, by way of Plotinus, to the works of 
the Pseudo-Dionysius and John Scottus
Eriugena, both of whom make key contributions
to the idea of superlative life. But the way in
which they think life in terms of time has within
it a “heretical” strand, in which superlative
life and its positivity is, in turn, thought in
terms of negativity and what Eriugena calls
nihil . The enigmatic turn for these thinkers
is,  then, a superlative life that is also
“nothing.” 2.2 LIFE AS TIME IN PLOTINUS To begin
with, let us consider the concept of the
superlative. In its most  general sense, the
concept of the superlative is about
transcendence, about that which is
fundamentally or absolutely beyond. If we
posit, for example, a First Cause that
conditions all instances of causality, then we
conceive of this Cause as superlative to any
particular instances of causality . The same
can be said with regard to a Prime Mover. But this
being-beyond is also a transcendence that
encompasses, that conditions, and that is,
onto-logically speaking, necessary. The
superlative is not only beyond all that is, but
its being-beyond fundamentally conditions
all that is. This last point also means that, at
some level, the superlative is indelibly
connected to all that is—the First Cause not
only conditions all instances of causa-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    44
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 29 tion, but is, in some
minimal sense, in effect “in” each of those
instances  of causality. The question that
arises from the superlative is precisely how to
think the superlative as at once absolutely
transcendent and yet mini-mally immanent.
This question becomes especially prescient in
Neoplatonic thinking.  Here, the synthesis of
Greek and early Christian thought opens onto a
set  of questions that would preoccupy Medieval
philosophers for centuries to come. At the
center of Neoplatonism is the question of the
superla-tive as a dynamical concept. And one of
the challenges that this concept of the
superlative brings with it is the following:
between the world— contingent, always
changing, fi  nite—and the
divine—conditioning, eter- nal, and  infi
nite—there must be some relation that does not
either simply  deify the world or naturalize the
divine. This means that the superlative  is not
simply an inaccessible and static
transcendence “out there,” but that, insofar
as it conditions, causes, and forms the world,
the superlative expresses a temporality that
is specifi  c to creation, generation, and pro-
duction. However this relation is
characterized, it must take into account  some
notion of the superlative in temporal terms.
The superlative is that which is absolutely
“beyond” at the same time that it is that which is
ab-solutely “within.” Consider the concept of
the One in Neoplatonism. The One is defi  ned  in
part as that which produces the Many. This means
that the One is “fi rst” causally, in terms of it
being ontologically necessary for thought  to
begin at all. But is the One itself produced?
This would then mean that the One is produced by
something else, a meta-One of sorts. If the One
is not produced, then this would imply that it
has always existed. But what then guarantees
its continued existence, its persistence?
That is, the per-sistence of the One would seem
to imply its continued production (but a
producti on tha t cann ot com e from o u tsi de i
tself) . So , does th e On e pro-duce itself? If it
does, then the One would also seem to take on the
at-tributes of time and temporality. But this
time specifi  c to the One would  have to be
different from the time of creaturely life and
the world, else the One would simply be one among
many things in the world. The compro-mise is to
suggest that the One is temporal, in the sense
that it produces itself as well as producing the
world, but that its temporality is beyond any
concept of creaturely or worldly temporality.
That is, the One persists in a superlative time.
Moreover, the concept of the superlative that
is presented, linked as  it is to time,
production, and process, implies that this
superlative time   is also a superlative life ,
being both the causal source and the principle

 30 chapter two of animation ( psukhe ˉ) of the
world. One of the results of this thinking  in
Medieval philosophy is the bifurcation of the
concept of life between  a superlative divine
life and a subordinate creaturely life. The
Life of the living, the creaturely life, the
life of the world, necessitates a grounding
concept of a life-beyond-life, a Life that
causes and conditions all possible instances
of living. Yet, since this Life is by defi  nition
absolutely tran- scendent, it remains
inaccessible to thought, lying beyond any
possible  conceptualization. The conjunction
of Life with time in the concept of the
superlative conditions any and all
possibility of thinking subordinate
instances of the living.
Neoplatonism—especially in the version
presented by Plotinus—presents  us with the
basic terms of this idea. The Enneads are often
described as  providing a tripartite
metaphysical schema: the One, which is in
itself ab- solutely transcendent and
unknowable; the Intellect, which encompasses
the primordial causes; and the Soul, which is
both the principle of anima-tion and the
emanation of the Intellect. The Enneads 
repeatedly describe  the procession from the
One, through the Intellect, via the Soul, and to
the world, as a process of emanation from a
source to the multiplicity of things it causes.
5 Not surprisingly, the analogies of the river
and the sun are fre- quently used to describe
this relation between the One and the world.
Scholarship on The Enneads  has raised a number
of questions regard- ing this system.6 For
example, is the relation between the One,
Intellect,  and Soul a hierarchical or a
topological relation? It is, certainly,
hierarchi-cal in that the divine “descends” or
emanates from the One, which is the source of all
things. The Intellect is the point of
mediation, the fi  rst move- m en t from divine
simp lici ty to earthly comp l exi ty . The Soul
enacts the movement of emanation from the
Intellect. But this priority may also be viewed
as an ontological priority, and the
relationship actually more topo-logical,
akin to concentric circles. Such a
relation—from pyramidal strata to concentric
circles—would emphasize the pervasive
quality of the One within each “level” of
emanation (a situation not totally absent in
The En- neads ). This does not, of course, imply
that the concept of the One in Plo- tinus is a
fully immanentist concept. It does bring to the
foreground the issue of the temporality of the
One-Intellect-Soul relation, based as it is on
the dynamical and processual acts of creation,
emanation, and radiation. The key term here is
Soul ( yu¯c hv), of which Plotinus has a very
particu- lar defi  nition in mind.7 The Soul
is—as it is with Aristotle—a principle of 
animation or a life-principle. The Soul is not
simply that which guaran-

which  things are brought into existence, by
which the uncreated is created, and so forth.
For Plotinus the Soul is also indissociable
from the processes of emanation and radiation
that distribute the One, via the Intellect,
into the world. The Soul is not only a point of
mediation, closely associated with
Intellect; it is the very continuum between the
One (as absolutely tran-scendent) and the
world (as fully contingent). “For the Soul 
(yuch Ì) is many  things, is all, is the Above and
the Beneath to the totality of life (zwh~ ): and 
each of us is an Intellectual Cosmos, linked to
this world by what is low- est in us, but, by what
is highest, to the Divine Intellect.”8 As that
which establishes the continuum between the
“Above” and the  “Beneath,” the Soul is, for
Plotinus, internally differentiated as well.
In the opening pages of the First Ennead (which
was, at one time, given the title “On the
Animate” by Porphyry), Plotinus asks “whether
a distinction is to be made between Soul and
Essential Soul (between an individual Soul and
the Soul-Kind in itself).” 9 In the Fourth
Ennead, Plotinus returns again to this 
question, suggesting further distinctions
between the individual Soul, the “World-Soul”
(the Soul as manifested in and as the world), the
“All-Soul” or actively emanating Soul in
itself, and the “Hypostatic Soul” (where the
Soul in itself becomes nearly
indistinguishable from the Intellect). What
all these internally differentiated types of
Soul have in common  is this principle of
animation or vitality, and it is for this reason
that the Soul is, for Plotinus, indelibly
linked to a concept of life: “we sum all into a
collected unity once more, a sole Life in the
Supreme . . . thus we know Identity, a concept or,
rather, a Life never varying, not becoming what
pre-viously it was not, the thing immutably
itself, broken by no interval, and knowing
this, we know Eternity.” 10 On this level, the
Soul is a principle of  transcendence; it is not
this or that particular instance of the living,
not this or that particular manifestation in
the world. It is that which condi-tions every
possible instance of the living, while
remaining itself above and beyond those
instances: “Thus we come to the defi  nition: the
Life  (zwhÌ)—instantaneously entire,
complete, at no point broken into period or 
part—which belongs to the Authentic Existent
by its very existence, this is the thing we were
probing for—this is Eternity.” 11 For
Plotinus, the Soul has one aspect that is
unchanging (though it  conditions change),
infi  nite (though it structures the fi  nite),
and eternal  (though it is itself a dynamic,
temporal principle). It is defi  ned more by its 
upward association with the One, than it is by
the multiplicity of things in the natural,
caused world. Plotinus’ evocation of the
eternal is quite  ±

    </p></div><p>
    
 32 chapter two intentional, in that the Soul can
be regarded as precisely that which does  not
itself change: “That which neither has been nor
will be, but simply possesses being, that which
enjoys stable existence as neither in process
of change nor having ever changed.” 12 However,
as we’ve already seen, the Soul in The Enneads 
also has an- other aspect, one that is
intimately tied to temporality, change, and
the  dynamic emanation or radiation of the
world. While Plotinus never states that the
Soul is identical with the world, it does,
nevertheless, have an important temporal
association with the world. But if the Soul is
defi  ned  in its temporality , how can it remain
absolutely transcendent to all that changes?
The Third Ennead contains an important
meditation on the Soul, Life, and Time, where
Plotinus outlines the problem: Putting forth
its energy in act after act, in a constant
progress of nov- elty , the Soul produces
succession as well as act; taking up new pur
-poses added to the old it brings thus into being
what had not existed in that former period when
its purpose was still dormant and its life was
not as it since became: the life is changed and
that change carries with it a change of Time.
Time, then, is contained in differentiation of
Life; the ceaseless forward movement of Life
brings with it unending Time; and Life as it
achieves its stages constitutes past Time. 13
The important phrase here comes near the end:
“Time . . . is contained in  differentiation of
Life.” The Soul is defi  ned as a principle of
animation or  life because it is inherently a
temporal principle, manifested in the very
persistence of the Soul as an emanation that
goes on forever and that never ceases. The Soul,
then, is a principle of life-beyond-life (or
Life with a capi-tal “L”); it is a principle of
Life that is at once manifested in the living but
which is not reducible to the living. And it is
here that Plotinus shifts from the more common
notion of the living ( zwhv) to the
life-principle ( yu¯chÈ).  Unlike the
particular instances of the living, which are
constrained by the fi  nitude of time, the Soul is
a Life that is in excess, a “ceaseless” Life 
operating through an “unending” time. This
would seem to be in confl  ict with the earlier
pronouncement that  the Life of the Soul is
identical to Eternity, to that which is beyond
time. So much does Plotinus link Soul, Life, and
Time together in a triangula-tion that he can
ask rhetorically, “Would it, then, be sound to
defi  ne Time  as the Life of the Soul ( croÈnon ti~
le Ègoi y uc h~) in movement as it passes  from one
stage of act or experience to another?”14 His
reply is telling, for it  becomes indicative of
much subsequent thinking on the topic: ±

  superlative life 33 Yes; for Eternity, as we
have said, is Life in repose, unchanging, self-
identical, always endlessly complete; and
there is to be an image of E t e r n i t y — T i m e — s u c h  a n 
i m a g e  a s  t h i s  l o w e r  A l l  p r e s e n t s  o f  t h e  Higher
Sphere. Therefore over against that higher
Life ( zwh~ ) there  must be another life ( zwhÌn),
known by the same name as the more veri- table
Life of the Soul ( yuch~ ) . . .  15 Here again we see
Aristotle’s split between
that-which-is-living and that-
by-which-the-living-is-living, between the
living and Life. Here we also see an emphasis on
the dynamic principle of the creation,
causality, and formation of the world. But what
Plotinus does is to place this concept of the
Soul squarely between a principle of absolute
transcendence (the One), and a manifestation
of emanation (the world, as caused by the Soul).
The Soul is not just a principle of animation or
life, but a principle of me-diation as well. It
sits, nestled between the absolutism of the One
and its pervasive spreading-out or emanation
in the world. The Soul is, in a sense,
Janus-faced, with one side “in repose” and
unchanging, turning to-wards a contemplation
of the One, and another side that is actively in
op-eration, emanating the world. In fact,
given this bifurcation between the
Soul-as-eternal and the Soul-as-temporal, we
can suggest something fur-ther about
Plotinus’ concept of the Soul: the Soul is
precisely that which contains the duplicity,
if not the contradictions, inherent in the
concept of Life . For Plotinus, the Soul
establishes a continuum between the One and  the
world; but it is also internally
differentiated between many kinds of Soul.
This dual movement of a continuum and a
differentiation, of a  drawing-together and a
spreading-apart, raises a number of problems
for  the concept of the Soul, which Plotinus
outlines in the Fourth Ennead 16:  the Soul is
everywhere present in all things and yet it
still remains sin-gular; the Soul, as the
continuum between the One and the world, is both 
immaterial and material; the Soul, as both a
derivation from the One and  an emanation of the
world, is at once eternal and temporal, infi 
nite and  fi nite: . . . over against that Movement
of the Intellectual Soul there must be  the
movement of some partial phase; over against
that Identity, Un-changeableness and
Stability there must be that which is not
constant in the one hold but puts forth
multitudinous acts; over against that Oneness
without extent or interval there must be an
image of oneness, a unity of link and
succession; over against the immediately Infi 
nite  ±±

 34 chapter two and All-comprehending, that
which tends, yes, to infi  nity but by tend- ing to
a perpetual futurity; over against the Whole in
concentration,  there must be that which is to be
a whole by stages never fi  nal.17 With Plotinus
we get a concept of Life that is really a
life-beyond-life, but  also a
life-within-life, insofar as it is
dynamically emanative and continu-ous with
all instances of the living. This results in a
tension that is espe-cially evident in the
meditations on time and temporality in The
Enneads .  And this tension begins to become
formulated in terms of limitation and
negation—albeit tentatively—in Patristic
thinkers such as Augustine and in the early
Scholasticism of Anselm. Both hint at a concept
of the di-vine that is at once transcendent and
immanent, static and dynamic, and, above all,
as something that cannot be positively
thought. 2.3 ON THE SUPERLATIVE Let us call this
life-beyond-life, or really, this
Life-beyond-the-living, su- perlative life .
It both persists in a continuum that cuts across
all instances  of the living, while at the same
time existing apart from any particular
instance of the living as its ground or
condition. It is a delimited life, a life that is
superlative because it is not fi  nite and never
“runs out.” While it  is Aristotle who fi  rst
articulates the distinction between Life and
the liv- ing, it is Plotinus who gives us a
concept of Life that is characterized by a
tension between the superlative perfection of
the divine and the dynamic, processual
generosity that is also identical with the
divine. Superlative life is neither the
principle of life in itself, nor the concrete
instance of the liv-ing, but an ontological
necessity positing a background excess (Life)
from which manifestations of this excess are
foregrounded (the living). Superla-tive life
is, quite simply, an ontology of Life that is
thought of in terms of time, temporality, and
process. But superlative life has several
sides to it, a major and a minor key. The  major key
is that of positive theology: Augustine,
Anselm, and Aquinas. Positive theology
proceeds to think the superlative in terms of
affirmative assertions of divine attributes;
its major motifs are light and radiation. It
aims for beatitude, the moment at which reason
is superseded by faith. In-sofar as it utilizes
negation, this negation is always subordinate
to affirma-tion, and always sublimated (the
negative statement “God is not-living” always
turns into “God is the most perfect Life”).
Positive theology has a number of political
advantages as well. Its motifs of light and
radiation not only reaffirm a single,
centralized divine source, but, in its
Neoplatonic 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    50
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 35 variant, it also assures a
hierarchy of processes, causes, and
distributions,  from one circle to the next,
from a higher layer to a lower layer, along the
great chain of beings. In contrast to this, we
can consider several examples of negative the-
ology, which, arguably, remains the minor key
of Medieval philosophy. 18  Frequently,
negative theology is interpreted such that it
can be brought  within the ambit of positive
theology. Negative theology also has within it
a number of important ambiguities, specifi 
cally regarding the idea of su- perlative life
and the role of negation in thinking the
superlative. Recently, negative theology has
become a central preoccupation of continental
phi-losophy, especially as regards the role of
aporia, negation, and limit in the debate over
the “post-theological.” 19 For our purposes
here, the thinkers  we will consider are the
Pseudo-Dionysius and John Scottus Eriugena.
In  contrast to the motifs of light and
radiation, the motifs these thinkers pre-fer
are those of darkness, shadow, and
nothingness. This negative theol-ogy does not
lead straight to beatitude, but often ends up
somewhat lost, wandering amidst divergent
paths of doubt, confusion, and even, at times,
skepticism. While positive theology always
sublimates the negative into the positive,
negative theology employs a different
strategy, that of contra-diction,
limitation, and irresolution. Negation in
negative theology is not just a temporary
“not-X” but an absolute “not-X,” a notion that
leads both the Pseudo-Dionysius and Eriugena
to consider a contradictory “superla-tive
negation.” The point in examining the
tradition of negative theology is not to sug-
gest that it is somehow more accurately able to
“get at” the divine, much  less the concept of
life, for both the Pseudo-Dionysius and
Eriugena are far from being traditional
theologians. But neither is the point to
suggest tha t  think e r s  s u c h  as  th es e  ar e  o u trigh
t  h e r e ti cs  o r  p r o t o- a th e i s t s  ( e v e n  though
their works were often accused of heresy and
later dubbed “panthe-ist”). The point in
examining the tradition of negative theology
is that it is unique in the way that it both
internalizes classical thinking about the
life-principle, while at the same time it
displays an acute awareness of the challenges
to thought itself that such a concept evokes.
Negative theology is unique in that it most
clearly articulates the contradictions
inherent in any attempt to ontologize Life. It
is this conjunction of “life” (as
superla-tive) and “nothing” (as a form of
negation) that we will trace in both the
Pseudo-Dionysius and subsequently in
Eriugena. Bearing in mind the Plo-tinian
framework for the idea of superlative life, we
can begin with a con-sideration of the role of
“apophatic life” in the Pseudo-Dionysius,
before considering the conjunction of Life and
nihil  in the thought of Eriugena.

 36 chapter two 2.4 SUPERLATIVE LIFE I:
PSEUDO-DIONYSIUS M y s ti cal  wri ting s  ha v e  a  t e n
u o us  s ta tus  in  p hil o s o p hi cal  di s co ur s e .  On   the
one hand, a number of thinkers who are part of the
Western philo-sophical canon (Augustine,
Aquinas) also wrote in the “key” of mystical
discourse, and works such as The Cloud of
Unknowing  or The Dark Night  of the Soul have
established mystical writing as a tradition in
its own right. On the other hand, in the public
consciousness mystical writing is often
regarded as being too close to its uncouth,
modern cousins—“new age” spiritualism,
occult and paranormal studies, or, at its most
banal, religious self-help. However, the fl 
owering of mystical texts in the early 
monotheistic traditions provides us with a set
of texts with which to pose certain ontological
questions. It is also worth noting that
mystical theol-ogy itself is as varied as
Medieval philosophy. Mystical theology
writings often note how the idea of a principle
of life, of a life-beyond-life, even “a life
beyond being” (in the words of the
Pseudo-Dionysius), is at the same tim e  spo k en  o
nl y  thr o u gh  th e  co n cep ts  an d  langua g e  o f  n e ga ti
o n ,  dar k -ness, and “nothing.” A word should be
said about the Pseudo-Dionysius, an author
with no  name. Four major works are attributed to
him: The Mystical Theology ,  The Divine Names ,
The Celestial Hierarchy , and The
Ecclesiastical Hier- archy . The fi  rst two are
works of mystical theology, the last two deal
more  specifi  cally with institutional and
doctrinal aspects of the Church. The  author was
originally thought to be one Dionysius the
Areopagite, briefl  y  mentioned in Acts 17:34, a
convert and follower of Paul. 20 But, as early as 
the sixth century, the authorship of the texts
ascribed to Dionysius the Areopagite were
called into question. 21 Part of the reason for
the disputa- tion may have been the ideas
attributed to Dionysius: he is, along with
several other authorities, cited as a
monophysite thinker, believing that Christ
has only one nature, which is divine (as opposed
to Christ having a twofold nature, divine and
human). Such topics were intensely debated in
the fi  fth century as early Christianity
struggled to articulate a coher- ent boundary
between orthodoxy and heresy. In addition, the
works of the Corpus Areopagiticum  show a marked
Neoplatonic infl  uence, which plays  a part in
the more mystical passages, as well as
participating in the ongo-ing and confl  icted
synthesis of Aristotelian, Neoplatonic, and
early Chris- tian thinking. Despite the
disputed authorship, the Corpus
Areopagiticum  continued  to exercise a strong
infl  uence in Medieval philosophy and
theology—the  anonymous author is cited
numerous times by Scholastic thinkers such 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    52
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 37 as Aquinas and by
late-Medieval mystics such as Nicholas of
Cusa. Works  from the Corpus  were translated
into Latin numerous times—in the early  ninth
century, by Hilduin, abbot of a Parisian
monastery (reportedly under  the patronage of
Dionysius), and in the late ninth century, by
the Irish phi-losopher John Scottus Eriugena.
The two works from the Corpus Areopagiticum 
that have exercised  the most infl  uence are The
Mystical Theology and The Divine Names . As 
recent scholarship has noted, they are
important not only as documents  of the mystical
theology tradition, but they also contain
innovations in philosophical refl  ection on
the logic of negation. 22 The former is a brief 
but dense poetic meditation on method. In it the
Pseudo-Dionysius makes  the important
distinction between “affirmative” or
“positive” theology and “negative” theology.
The latter work, The Divine Names , is a more 
extended, more “philosophical” work divided
into chapters with sub-headings. In it the
Pseudo-Dionysius meditates on a number of
topics, in-cluding the method of negative
theology, the divine nature, creation and
creatures, “unity and differentiation,” the
Neoplatonic motif of light, and the nature of
evil. For our purposes, we will look at two
specifi  c points:  in The Mystical Theology , the
introduction of the concept of negation,  and
its development into a concept of “superlative
life” in The Divine Names . 2.4.1 Negative vs.
Affirmative Theology The body of work ascribed
to the Pseudo-Dionysius raises the issue of the
limits of thought. T o what extent can the divine
be thought as such? When we give names to the
divine, referring to it as “One,” or “Good,” or
“Life,” to what extent do such names imply a
knowledge of the divine or a comprehension of
the transcendent? Would not an adequate
thought of the divine be tantamount to an
experience of the divine itself? Would such a
“divine thought” also imply a “divine life”?
There is a thread that runs from Neoplatonism
through to the high Scholasticism of Aquinas
that meditates at length on such questions. 23
One of the central problems  in thinking the
divine lies in the very act of naming the
divine—is nam-ing also knowing, and if so, how
can the fi  nite, contingent, human crea- ture
make such a claim to know the infi  nite,
unbounded, and transcen- dent realm of the
divine, without actually making a claim for the
divinity of the creature itself? Often this
conundrum is resolved by a distinction between
a statement that  something is and knowing what 
something is;  thus one could safely posit, and
even prove, the existence of God without 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    53
    </p></div><p>
    
 38 chapter two making any undue claims about
knowing anything beyond this mere fact  of God’s
existence. But such resolutions are only
temporary, for, even if the “divine name” 
signifi  es  n o thing  m o r e  than  m er e  e xis t en ce , 
this  e xis t en ce  in  i ts e lf  has   t o  b e  a cco un t ed  f o r
,  o r  a t  l eas t  q ualifi  ed: if God exists, does this
imply  that God is also subject to the
contingencies of life and death, as are crea-
tures? If not, then one is led into a labyrinth
where one has two choices: either one would have
to affirm God’s existence in a qualifi  ed way
(e.g.,  as a “super-existence,”
“super-eminence,” or purely positive
existence), or one would have to entertain the
idea that the divine or the transcen-dent is, in
a sense, “nothing” (literally, no thing, no
existent). In this latter mode, the divine is
given a paradoxical name, the name of negation:
God is “not-One” (since a numerical notion of
One implies that something can be added to it),
God is “not-Life” (since there is no life or
death in the divine), God is “not-Good” (since
the good presupposes a state of falling-away or
evil). The long tradition of meditation on the
divine names is often split:  those who make
positive claims for the divine (the divine can
be named, but qualifi  ed in a way that places it
transcendentally above all things),  and those
who make negative claims for the divine (the
divine can only be  named as not-this or
not-that). The works of the Pseudo-Dionysius
mark an important moment in the latter,
negative tradition, and they do so be-cause of
the particular concept of negation that they
propose, a concept that works against both the
positive tradition as well as the negative-
privative tradition. Poetically dense and
often enigmatic, the short text entitled The
Mys- tical Theology  sets out the problematic:
The fact is that the more we take fl  ight upward,
the more our words  are confi  ned to the ideas we
are capable of forming; so that now as we  plunge
into that darkness which is beyond intellect,
we shall fi  nd our- selves not simply running
short of words but actually speechless and 
unknowing.24 The more thought reaches upward
and outward, the more it increasingly  comes up
against the limits of thought itself; the
pinnacle of thought is its very foundation,
precisely that which it cannot think. The
author contin-ues, noting that as one works up
from the domain of creatures to that of the
divine life, “from what is below up to the
transcendent . . . the more 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    54
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 39 language falters, and when
it has passed up and beyond the ascent, it will 
turn silent completely,” since, at that point,
it will effectively be indistin-guishable
from the divine itself. 25 For the
Pseudo-Dionysius, the problem  is not simply in
fi  nding the adequate words or the most
appropriate names  for the divine; rather, the
problem has to do with the horizon of thought
itself. Let us take a modern viewpoint of this
problematic, and suggest that, for the
Pseudo-Dionysius, the problem of the “divine
names” is really a problem of the unthought, a
problem of the blind spots of thinking. As with
many writers in the mystical theology
tradition, the divine not only positively
signifi  es the transcendent or the
supernatural, but it also comes  to demarcate
the very boundaries of thinking itself. This
problematic leads the Pseudo-Dionysius to
distinguish between  two methods for thinking
the divine. There is, fi  rst, the “affirmative
the- ologies,” by which one positively
designates attributes to the divine, usu- ally
of the simple form “God is x ,” where x is most
often some attribute  found among creatures
(especially human creatures), but “raised up”
to its most perfect state. This is the via
affirmativa  (katafatikh  or kataphatic).  It is
the affirmative way, “in which God is described
as good, existent, life, wisdom, power, and
whatever other things pertain to the
conceptual names for God.” 26 Thus, if x is
“life,” then this attribute of being alive is 
beyond any instance of creaturely or natural
life, marred as it is by tempo-rality, decay,
and death. The via affirmativa  or affirmative
theology is dependent on and begins  from the
creaturely world, from human attributes such
as being “good” or “wise,” and then attempts to
work its way up from there. Such a method invites
an anthropomorphic tendency as well, in which
the divine ob-tains the characteristics of the
earthly and human domain. In this case, the 
attributes of the divine are “analogies of God
drawn from what we  perceive . . . his anger,
grief, and rage, of how he is said to be drunk and
hungover, of his oaths and curses, of his
sleeping and waking, and indeed of all those
images we have of him, images shaped by the
workings of the symbolic representations of
God.” 27 Despite this intriguing, rather pagan 
image of the drunken God, the Pseudo-Dionysius
notes the limitations of affirmative
theology—all affirmations of the divine and
the transcen-dent must by necessity end up
negating themselves in their attempt to posit
that which is beyond all positing—indeed,
anthropomorphism is this limitation itself.
It is here that, in a characteristically
cryptic passage, the Pseudo-  Dionysius
distinguishes the via affirmativa  from the via
negativa , the 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    55
    </p></div><p>
    
 40 chapter two kataphatic from the apophatic ( a
ΔpoÈfatikh ), affirmative theology from 
negative theology: Now it seems to me that we
should praise the denials quite differently 
than we do the assertions. When we made
assertions we began wi th the fi  rst things,
moved down through intermediate terms until we 
reached the last things. But now as we climb from
the last things up to the most primary we deny all
things so that we may unhiddenly know that
unknowing which itself is hidden from all those
possessed of knowing amid beings, so that we may
see above being that darkness concealed from
all the light among beings. 28 There are two
movements described here: a movement of
ascension and  descension, and a movement of
affirmation and negation. The Pseudo-
Dionysius combines them in a particular way:
the via affirmativa  is, for  him, a top-down
approach in which one begins from the positive
asser- tion “God is x ,” where x is regarded as
perfected, and then one proceeds  in  a  N e o p l a t o
ni c  m ann e r  fr o m  thi s  p e rf e c t e d  a t tri b u t e  x to
its less and less perfect instantiations in the
world of creatures. The via affirmativa   is
therefore a method characterized by
“descending assertions.” By con-trast, the
via negativa  is a more bottom-up approach,
whereby one suc- cessively negates the
existing, creaturely world, eventually
arriving at a kind of degree-zero of the divine,
an absolute minimalism of the divine whose
logical conclusion is nothingness and
silence. The via negativa  is  therefore a method
characterized by “ascending negations.” The
Pseudo-Dionysius provides another, perhaps
more rigorous explanation in the fol-lowing
chapter: When we assert what is beyond every
assertion, we must then proceed  from what is
most akin to it, and as we do so we make the
affirmation o n  w hi c h  e v e rything  e ls e  d ep en ds . 
B u t  w h en  w e  d en y  tha t  w hi c h  is  beyond every
denial, we have to start by denying those
qualities which differ most from the goal we
hope to attain. 29 The via affirmativa  operates
on the analogy of distance from a center: as  one
moves further and further away from the divine
cause of all things,  the divine name or
attribute becomes less and less fully
identical with the divine itself—the one
becomes many, the good becomes acts of
goodness, life becomes living creatures, and
so on.
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 41 2.4.2 Superlative
Negation But the via negativa  is more
complicated. There are several types of nega-
tion presented in The Mystical Theology . In the
above passage, the Pseudo- Dionysius follows
with a rhetorical question: “Is it not closer to
reality  to say that God is life and goodness
rather than that he is air or stone? Is it not more
accurate to deny that drunkenness and rage can
be attributed to him than to deny that we can
apply to him the terms of speech and thought?”
The second part of the question is asked in the
manner of the via negativa —ascending from the
domain of the natural world to the su-
pernatural, one proceeds by successively
negating those attributes that are the most
opposed to the notion of the divine (e.g., from
abstract attributes such as fi  nitude,
temporality, and death to more
anthropomorphized at- tributes such as
desire, fear, or rage). But this type of
negation knows no limits, it has no end, for if
there were such an end, one would eventually
reach a point where everything inessential has
been negated, and what re-mains would
be—affirmatively, positively—the divine
name. Thus the via  negativa  would become the
penultimate instance of the via affirmativa , 
precisely that which is foreclosed in the very
concept of the divine as tran-scendent and
“beyond” all thought. However, this is not the
only kind of negation presented by the Pseudo-
Dionysius. Consider the fi  rst part of the
rhetorical question: “Is it not  closer to
reality to say that God is life and goodness
rather than that he is air or stone?” This is
asked in the manner of the via affirmativa —
assumedly the Pseudo-Dionysius would prefer
to attribute the Good and Life to the divine,
which more closely describe its essence, than
to say the divine is air or a rock (though the
latter is certainly more interest-ing). But
the via affirmativa  harbors within it a
movement of negation,  or really, a privation,
whereby the greater or lesser proximity to a
divine source dictates what can be positively
said of the divine. Thus, even the l o w li es t  cr ea
tur es ,  e v en  th e  roc ks ,  m us t  be  minimall y  a ttri b
u t ed  t o  th e  divine, insofar as they are the
products and the creations of the divine
Cre-ator. But, in true Neoplatonic fashion, it
is in the distance of the rock or the beast from
the divine source that the latter is
negated—privately—by the former. The rock or
the beast is thus the divine “minus” something,
a privative negation. Thus far, the Mystical
Theology  presents us with two types of
negation.  There is, fi  rst, the negation
inherent in the via affirmativa —“God is x ,” 
where x is a creaturely attribute minus its
imperfections. Let us refer to 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    57
    </p></div><p>
    
 42 chapter two this as privative negation . Then
we have the more active negation in the  via
negativa —“God is not- x,” where x is a
creaturely attribute defi  ned by  its
imperfections. This we can refer to as
oppositional negation . To these  two types of
negation—that of the via negativa  and that
which is inher- ent in the via affirmativa —the
Pseudo-Dionysius presents a third kind of 
negation. It comes in the fi  rst chapter, where
the author discusses the con- cept of the
transcendent: What has actually to be said
about the Cause of everything is this.  Since it
is the Cause of all beings, we should posit and
ascribe to it all the affirmations we make in
regard to beings, and, more appropriately, we
should negate all these affirmations, since it
surpasses all being. Now we should not conclude
that the negations are simply the oppo-sites of
the affirmations, but rather that the cause of
all is consider-ably prior to this, beyond
privations, beyond every denial, beyond every
assertion. 30 Using the example of creation and
causality, the Pseudo-Dionysius pro- poses a
third type of negation that is neither quite
that of opposition (in the via negativa ) nor
quite that of privation (in the via affirmativa
). The  passage nearly has the form of dialectic,
though it lacks the rigor found in later authors
such as Anselm or Eriugena. We begin with an
affirmation (“God is x ,” where x is qualifi  ed),
but, as we’ve seen, even the affirmation  holds a
negation within it, since the very defi  nition
of the divine is such  that no term is absolutely
identical to it. Thus, “God is x ,” but since x is 
qualifi  ed as perfected, as beyond any worldly
conception of x, the attribute  x really
surpasses itself, and in so doing, negates
itself (the x beyond all  possible instances of
x). In this regard, we really say “God is not- x”
insofar  as x is defi  ned by limitation and fi 
nitude. Importantly, the Pseudo-Dionysius
proposes that, even though a nega- tion follows
every affirmation, this particular type of
negation is not sim-ply the opposite of
affirmation. Here the author turns to the more
mystical language of that which is
transcendent and “beyond every assertion.”
This is the negation that is neither a privation
nor an opposition, but, strangely, a kind of
affirmation—or better, a kind of affirmation
that is character-ized by its generosity, by
its germinality, by its being a transcendent
sort of negation that precedes all possibility
of affirmation. Here one says “God is x,” where x
is the negation of every particular instance of
x . This would  mean that the attribute x is
literally “no thing,” because it is never con-
strained by any particular instantiation—it
remains fully abstract. Thus,

  superlative life 43 the statement “God is good”
or “God is life” would imply a Good beyond  any
possible, particular manifestation of
goodness, a Life beyond any pos-sible
manifestation of the living. The Good and Life
are ontologically prior to and condition the
very possibility of thinking good acts and
living  beings—but they are never to be found
“in” those good acts or living beings. In this
third type of negation, negation is not
privative (that is, not that  which is taken away
or withdrawn), and not oppositional (that is,
not a  direct counterpoint or annulment).
Rather, it is superlative negation , a ne-
gation of all fi  nitude and limitation that is,
in the same breath, an affirma- tion of the limit
and fi  nitude of thought. In this superlative
negation, the  divine is defi  ned as being
negative because it is defi  ned as being beyond 
every possible conceptualization, thereby
always receding into a sort of dark, opaque
nether region that later authors such as
Eriugena will simply call nihil . This is an
assertion of transcendence—indeed, the
language of mysti- cal theology is teeming with
the poetics of transcendence. But, unlike the
tradition of affirmative theology, with its
evocations of beatifi  c light and  vision, here
we have a contradictory kind of transcendence,
one more char-acterized by shadows, darkness,
and the immanent limits of  knowledge— the
“darkness which is beyond intellect.” In
addition to the via affirma- tiva with its
privative negation, and in addition to the via
negativa  and its  oppositional negation, we can
say that the Pseudo-Dionysius also presents a
via superlativa , a contradictory form of
negation that is negation pre- cisely because
it is superlative. This is, arguably, the
central point of The Mystical Theology —that
ne- gation is not simp ly the opposi te of
affirmation. This insigh t structures both th e
n ega ti v e th eo l ogy tradi ti on, as w ell as th e
possibili ty of think -ing Life in relation to
the living. To understand how these types of
di-vine negation operate in the ontology of
life, we can now turn from the methodological
consideration of the Mystical Theology  to the
theological  and philosophical consideration
of The Divine Names , a longer and more  erudite
text, where we see the Pseudo-Dionysius
develop a concept of life in superlative terms.
In the opening sections of The Divine Names , the
Pseudo-Dionysius  warns against naively
applying the concepts of human thinking to the
di-vine realm, since by defi  nition the latter
lies beyond the comprehension of  the former.
One must, the author states, proceed in a manner
akin to the textual exegesis of scripture, “in a
manner surpassing speech and knowl-edge,”
leading to a place where “we reach a union
superior to anything available to us by way of
our own abilities or activities in the realm of
dis-

 44 chapter two course or of intellect.”31 In
short, scripture already outlines the
boundaries  of the discourse on the divine,
beyond which one should not go. However, the
passage immediately following does precisely
that, and  here the language of negative
theology can be detected: “Since the un-
knowing of what is beyond being is something
above and beyond speech, mind, or being itself,
one should ascribe to it an understanding
beyond being.” 32 Whil e th e Pseu do-Di on ysi us
is careful to n ote tha t this m ys ti - cal
unknowing beyond being itself is still within
the ambit of scripture,  already the assertion
of the indefi  nite “unknowing,” as a kind of
negative  knowledge beyond all knowledge,
begins to reveal the contradictions at  the
center of negative theology as a method. Put
simply, it appears that we can and cannot
adequately think the divine and the
transcendent. T h e  P s e u d o - D i o n y s i u s  t h e n  a t t e
m p t s  t o  m e d i a t e  t h i s  a n t i n o m y  b y   describing the
divine as “superlative”—a concept that is, as
we’ve seen, at the heart of the Plotinian
philosophy. This comes fi  rst by a rather an-
thropomorphized, paternal characterization
of the divine: “For, if we may trust the
superlative wisdom and truth of scripture . . .
the divine goodness is such that, out of concern
for our salvation, it deals out the
immeasur-able and infi  nite in limited
measures.” 33 The fi  gures used here are those of 
mystical theology and the threat or the danger
of the concept of the divine  itself—the light
that is too bright for human eyes, the thought
that is too profound for the human mind. The
direct, unmediated thought of the di-vine
would thus lead to either madness or death. For
the fi  nite, contingent  mind, the infi  nite and
eternal nature of the divine is thus rationed
out in  digestible portions, in a kind of divine
metabolism. Here it is the textual  exegesis and
its mediating concepts that negatively point
to the superla-tive nature of the divine as
surpassing all human comprehension: Just as
the senses can neither grasp nor perceive the
things of the mind,  just as representation and
shape cannot take in the simple and the
shapeless, just as corporeal form cannot lay
hold of the intangible and incorporeal, by the
same standard of truth beings are surpassed by
the infi nity beyond being, intelligences by
that oneness which is beyond  intelligence. 34
Using the analogies of dualism (matter-form,
sense-intellect, corporeal-  incorporeal),
the Pseudo-Dionysius here employs a strategy
that character- izes the entire text of The
Divine Names : he uses negation to think the 
divine, not in terms of something lacking, but
in terms of its superlative nature, its “life
beyond life,” its “being beyond being.” This is
precisely 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    60
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 45 the function of negation in
The Divine Names —to point to a superlative 
affirmation, which is itself another, higher
order of negation. Every asser- tion
concerning what cannot be thought is asserted
in thought, via a mul-tifarious language of
negative terms that point to the superlative.
2.4.3 Negation and Preexistent Life As we’ve
seen, the text of The Divine Names  deploys
negation in different  ways, which we can briefl 
y summarize below: • Privative terms, in which
the divine is regarded as lacking some- thing.
These often take the form of assertions about
the divine as  being without attributes that are
specifi  c to the creaturely domain; so the
privation here really leads to an assertion of
excess and su-perabundance. In this sense the
privations of the divine paradoxi-cally point
to its superlative, transcendent nature. Thus
the divine is “without cause,” since it is the
First or Primordial Cause, and “without form,”
since it is the form-giving principle. 35 It is
also, in  a phrase that turns back on itself, “the
Nameless One.”36 • Properly negative terms, of
which the Pseudo-Dionysius uses both  “not”
terms (“not-living,” “not-caused”) and
“non-” terms (“non-participation”). Take the
example of “not” terms: these are terms in which
the divine is described as superlative and
transcendent pre-cisely because it is not- x,
where x is a lessened or not- transcendent 
attribute whose derivative form points to a
more perfected, exem-plary form, or X. Thus,
while the divine is described as “Life,” it is 
understood that this divine Life is not the life
of living creatures, bound as it is by death and
fi  nitude—the divine is “not-living.” 37  The
same is said of the divine as not -caused or not -
willed. Again using the contradictory
language of negative theology, any
attribu-tion of the divine as X is only posited
as not- x (so that X = not- x by  exemplarism more
than opposition). • Indefi  nite terms, in which
the divine is, by its ineffable nature, de-
scribed in proximity to creaturely
attributes. These come in several variants,
including “in-” terms (“infi  nite”) and “un-”
terms (“un- changing,” “unnamed”). 38 Whereas
creaturely life is corporeal, the  divine is
incorporeal; whereas creaturely life is fi 
nite, the divine is  infi nite; whereas the life
of the creature is tangible, the divine life  is
intangible. Technically speaking, indefi 
nite terms are not nega-tive terms, since they
occupy a position that is between assertion 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    61
    </p></div><p>
    
 46 chapter two and negation, not-quite-this
and not-quite-that. But in the context  of The
Divine Names , the indefi  nite terms deploy
negativity by  taking an attribute of
creaturely life (fi  nitude, change) and then,
by  negating the limits of that
attribute—without positively naming the
openness beyond this delimitation—arriving
at the indefi  nite  (infi nite, unchanging). •
Hyperbolic terms, which are the most common in
The Divine  Names . These most often take an
attribute of creaturely life and  append the
prefi  x “super-” to it. The divine is
“superabundant” and  “supernatural.”39 It is
not simply a more perfected Life or Wisdom,  but
is “superabundant Life” and “superabundant
Wisdom.”40 Alter- nately, hyperbole is also
used in a metaphysical sense, in which
creaturely attributes are raised up by
reference to their essences: “It [the divine]
is the Life of the living, the being of beings, it
is the Source and the Cause of all life and of all
being, for out of its goodness it commands all
things to be and it keeps them going.” 41  “These
and similar terms,” the author notes, “concern
a denial in the sense of a superabundance.” 42
While there are nuances between these types of
negative terms, they are  united in the way they
assert a negation, which, by its negation,
points to an unassignable and unthinkable
domain beyond the negation. But there is
another way, aside from the use of negative
terms, in which negation is deployed in The
Divine Names . This comes in the second section,
where  the Pseudo-Dionysius discuses the
concept of “divine differentiation.” 43 
Addressing the problem of how a simple and
single divine nature produces the multiple,
differentiated aspects of creation (a problem
pervasive in Neoplatonism), the author
proceeds to describe the divine nature’s
pro-pensity for production : if
differentiation can be said to apply to the
generous procession of the  undifferentiated
divine unity, itself overfl  owing with
goodness and  dispensing itself outward toward
multiplicity, then the things united even
within this divine differentiation are the
acts by which it ir-repressibly imparts being,
life, wisdom and the other gifts of its all-
creative goodness. 44 The language here is that
of Neoplatonism and the proliferative produc-
tivity of the divine nature—fl  ux, fl  ow, and
emanation from an unlimited  source. A number of
key characteristics follow from this. The
divine na-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    62
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 47 ture is, fi  rst and
foremost, characterized by a generosity , as a
gift that con- tinually bestows its essence
outward towards creation (the passages that 
follow utilize the geometrical motif of the
radii of a circle, as well as the well-known
motif of the sun). “It fl  ows over in shares of
goodness to all.” 45  Insofar as the divine
nature is the primordial Cause of all things, it
is a superlative cause, one that never ceases
and is never totally expended. It produces
multiplicity and yet remains unifi  ed,
“dispensed to all without  ceasing to be a
unity.” 46 The divine nature is, in this sense,
defi  ned by be- ing a kind of divine excess, a
primal source that knows no limits.47 Taken
together, these two attributes—excess and
generosity—lead to  a model of production or
proliferation that is both distributive and
perva- sive: “Now this is unifi  ed and one and
common to the whole divinity, that  the entire
wholeness is participated in by each of those
who participate in it; none participates in
only a part.” 48 The divine is not simply above 
and beyond, transcendent and apart from
creaturely life. Neither is its sole  purpose
the cause of all creation. Rather, its very
nature is this contin-ual, dynamic process of
distribution. It is for this reason that the
Pseudo- Dionysius uses the Neoplatonic
language of participation (elsewhere de-
scribing the divine nature as
“nonparticipated”). Passages such as these
would be read centuries later by
theologian-philosophers such as Eriugena,
and the idea of a pervasive, distributive God
hints at a quasi-pantheistic understanding of
the divine (though the Pseudo-Dionysius never
makes such claims without qualifi  cation).
This notion of a pervasive, distributive
divine also brings with it the  same type of
superlative negation found in the use of
negative terms. A pervasive Source that is
everywhere is also one that is nowhere. Each
mo-ment of excess turns on another moment of
expenditure. Hence the con-tradictory
terminology of a full void, an empty excess, a
divine nature that is “full amid the emptying
act of differentiation,” an “unfi  lled
overfull- ness which produces, perfects, and
preserves all unity and multiplicity.” 49  The
divine is here not a static, inert, equivocal
principle or cause; rather, it seems to be
pervasively, even contagiously “in” every
instance of cre-ation, while still
maintaining its transcendent nature. But, as
we’ve seen, its transcendental nature can be
guaranteed only via the forms of negation
outlined above, negations that really point to
a superlative beyond, which itself remains
negative and “unnamed.” This idea, expressed
in the poetics of the mystical theology tradi-
tion, is signifi  cant for thinking about any
ontology of life, because it at- tempts to think
the divine as inherently dynamic and
processual, while still conserving its
conceptually transcendent structure. In The
Divine 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
 48 chapter two Names  there are three kinds of
concepts of life at work. There is, fi  rst,  the
creaturely life of the living, which the
Pseudo-Dionysius outlines in  a descending
hierarchy from Intelligences (supernatural
beings), Rational souls (human beings),
Irrational souls (animals), subsistence
(plants), and existence (things). 50 Here
“life” is subordinate to a larger concept of
either  Being or God, these latter concepts
superlative to all others. This in turn
requires a larger metaphysical principle for
the living, or 
that-by-which-the-living-is-living.
Crucially, in the sixth chapter of The  Divine
Names , the Pseudo-Dionysius uses the name
“Life” to describe the  ways in which “the divine
Life beyond life is the giver and creator of life
itself . . . From this Life souls have their
indestructibility, and every liv-ing being
and plant, down to the last echo of life, has
life.” 51 Furthermore,  this Life is both
ontologically and causally necessary, since
“it gives to life  itself the capacity to be life,
and it gives to everything alive and to every
form of life the existence appropriate to it.”
52 So necessary is this concept  ontologically
that the Pseudo-Dionysius even acknowledges
the Life in  that lowest of low life forms, the
demonic: “So overabundant is its good-ness
that it reaches down even to demonic life which
draws its life and its demonic life from this and
from no other cause.” 53 In addition to the
creaturely, natural life and its supernatural
cause,  the Pseudo-Dionysius also hints at a
life beyond even this divine Life. “All life and
living movement comes from a Life which is above
every life and is beyond the source of life.” 54
Even the divine Life as the source of all in-
stances of the living, must itself have some
ontological ground, one that would take into
account the dynamic and process-based
production of the living and the
self-production of Life. And this is precisely
what the con-cept of superlative life does.
That is, in the idea of the processual,
distribu-tive, pervasive divine nature, the
Pseudo-Dionysius also evokes this third type
of life, a superlative life that is
transcendent even to the other divine names
(“One,” “Being,” “Good,” etc.). Superlative
life is inherently dynamic and temporal, but
not in the lim- iting, fi  nite way in which
creaturely life or the living are. What
conceptu- ally guarantees the possibility of
thinking this type of superlative life, this
type of process or pervasiveness, cannot
simply be its opposite (being vs. becoming,
stasis vs. change, eternity vs. temporality),
because one then has to account for the movement
from one term to its opposite (thus
intro-ducing more mediating concepts). But
this superlative life cannot simply be
identical with the creaturely life or the
living, for this merely begs the question of
form and causality
(that-by-which-the-living-is-living). The
superlative life can only be
beyond-the-beyond if it can at once 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    64
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 49 remain an ontological
foundation (without which the concept of the
living  cannot be thought) while at the same time
preserving its inherently pro-cessual and
pervasive characteristics (as cause,
form-giving, and animat-ing). The
Pseudo-Dionysius refers to this as the
preexistent  of life, wherein  the divine “lives
and grants life out of that Life surpassing all
life and it preexists in it as the single Cause of
life.” 55 The concept of the “preexis- tent” is
introduced earlier in The Divine Names , where
the Pseudo-Diony- sius attempts to assert an
ontological principle that is prior to all
things, and which is a combination of existence
(but an existence beyond all exis-tence) and
productivity (but an endless, superabundant
productivity): “Ev-ery being and all the ages
derive their existence from the Pre existent . .
.  The Preexistent is the source and is the cause
of all eternity, of time and  of every kind of
being.” 56 Th us th e preexisten t is wha t groun ds
superla- tive life as a double-transcendence,
the superlative life beyond the rela-tion
between Life and the living. The preexistent is
condition (ontological foundation), cause
(form-giving, productive), culmination
(completion of the ends of life), and
ineffability (by its superlative, equivocal
nature). 57  But its curious introduction in the
text also seems to dangerously open up an infi 
nite regress. At the heart of the preexistent is
thus this tension  between the need for a stable
ontological foundation in which life can be 
thought at all, and the corresponding
assertion of the superabundantly dynamic and
processual nature of the divine.
Enigmatically, what the Pseudo-Dionysius
provides in The Divine Names  is a concept of
superla- tive life that is characterized by
contrary negations and affirmations—a 
superlative life that cannot be thought, and a
preexistent positivity that affirms a
“beyond-the-beyond.” Nevertheless, the
concept of superlative life as presented in The
Di- vine Names  does have discernable contours.
Superlative life is, fi  rst and  foremost,
transcendent and beyond all possible
instances of creaturely life or the living. But
its being “beyond” in no way implies its
separation, its removal, or even its
differentiation from the living. Hence the
Neo-platonic conundrum of a Source that is
pervasive, a Cause that is distrib-uted.
Superlative life, as pervasive and
distributed, never runs out in its
expenditures; it is a pure vitalist surplus,
characterized by generosity and
superabundance. It is (in terms evocative of
Georges Bataille’s own mysti-cal theology), a
superabundant expenditure, a divine
negation. This leads to a third aspect of
superlative life, which is that its
pervasiveness and dis-tribution are at once
absolute and yet not total, not exhaustive.
This fol-lows from the processual and dynamic
aspects of the divine—there is no outside and
yet the superlative life of the divine never
ceases to produce, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    65
    </p></div><p>
    
 50 chapter two never runs out or is depleted. As
the life-beyond-all-life, the concept of su-
perlative life is therefore preexistent 
(transcendently immanent), generous   (excess
and expenditure), and pervasive (absolute and
not total). 2.4.4 Excess, Evil, and Nonbeing
These three characteristics come together in
an interesting way in the Pseudo-Dionysius’
discussion of evil. The primary—not to mention
the secondary—literature on the theology of
evil is vast; nearly every theolo-gian of the
Patristic and later eras commented at length on
the problem of evil. Thus it is no surprise to fi 
nd an extended meditation on evil in The  Divine
Names . 58 For our purposes here, this little
treatise on evil is of in- terest because it
appears to offer a direct counterpoint to the
other passages  in The Divine Names  that point to
a superlative life that is characterized  by its
excess and abundance. Taking his cue from
scripture, the Pseudo- Dionysius notes that
the problem of evil has to do with how something
can produce its opposite—that is, if the divine
is “Good” in a superlative sense, then how can
its opposite, evil, derive from it? This
counterpoint to superlative life is,
interestingly, conceptualized in analogous
ways to the divine nature—as being beyond all
being, as literally “no thing,” and as
thinkable only via a logic of negation. Both the
superlative life of the di-vine and the demonic
life of evil appear to present limits to
thought—both the divine and the demonic point
to a domain beyond which thought can proceed
only via negation. In its general outlines, the
concept of evil presented in The Divine  Names  is
a fairly orthodox one. Evil is not simply the
opposite of Good,  for, inasmuch as the Good is
identical with the divine, it can have no
op-posite (since this would then necessitate a
higher being that would encom-pass both Good
and Evil, and so on ad infi  nitum ). The Good (as
the di- vine) must be absolutely Good, and Evil
must therefore be privative, or the 
taking-away of goodness; Evil is thus not a
thing in itself, but a defect, an  imperfection.
“Nor does evil inhere in beings, for if all
beings derive from the Good and if the Good is
inherent in and embraces all beings, then evil
has no place among the things that have being or
else it is to be located in the Good.” 59
Following the Neoplatonic cosmology, the
further away one  is from the divine,
superlative source of the Good, the less one has
good-ness, and the closer one is to this
ambiguous non-state of evil. But it is this last
point that is of particular interest—“evil has
no place  among . . .  being.” The
Pseudo-Dionysius repeats this mantra several
times: “Evil therefore in itself has neither
being, goodness, the capacity to 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    66
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 51 beget, nor the ability to
create things which have being and goodness”;
“So,  then, evil has no being nor does it inhere in
the things that have being.”60  How can evil,
which has, by being named, some minimal being,
also not  have being? The convoluted dialectics
of this question are outlined in the middle of
the fourth chapter of the Divine Names : Evil is
not a being; for if it were, it would not be
totally evil. Nor is it a  nonbeing; for nothing
is completely a nonbeing, unless it is said to be
in the Good in the sense of beyond-being. For the
Good is established far beyond and before
simple being and nonbeing. Evil, by contrast,
is not among the things that have being nor is it
among what is not in being. It has a greater
nonexistence and otherness from the Good than
nonbeing has. 61 Let us pause a bit on the twists
and turns of this passage. Evil is defi  ned,  in
the fi  rst sentence, as that which is not a being.
Already, this moves us  away from the more
orthodox defi  nition of evil as privation or
lack, as a  distance from the Source, the Good.
For if evil has any degree of being, it  ceases to
be evil and is merely a defective or derivate
instance of the super-lative, divine Good.
This would seem to imply a concept of evil that is
not privation—that is, partial negation—but a
negation without reserve. 62 But in the second
sentence, the Pseudo-Dionysius immediately
de- nies this possibility, since nothing can
have absolute negation, absolute 
nonbeing—unless it is the superlative life of
the divine itself. Here the au- thor is careful
to note that evil cannot simply the opposite of
being (“non-being”), and in fact nothing can
absolutely have nonbeing, unless,
para-doxically, it can obtain absolute
negation via a superlative means—that is,
through the via negativa . For the
Pseudo-Dionysius, evil is thus not  privative,
it “has no being,” even in the most minimal
sense. Evil must therefore be not a partial
negation (privation), but an absolute
negation. But this is precisely how the
Pseudo-Dionysius, in The Divine Names  and  The
Mystical Theology , describes the divine
nature—as that which is ab- solutely beyond all
being and nonbeing, beyond all thought, and
therefore “nothing.” The only instance of
absolute negation is one that turns on it-self
and becomes absolute positivity, pure
superabundance and excess. If evil is neither
partial negation (privation) nor absolute
negation (the  superlative), then what is it? On
a conceptual level, the proximity of evil in
this regard to the divine reveals some
important tensions in the idea of superlative
life. Insofar as both the divine and demonic are
“nothing,” and insofar as they can be thought
only via negation, what then is the

 52 chapter two ontological difference between
them? This conundrum is expressed in the 
sentences that follow in the citation above: in
the same way that evil is neither being nor
nonbeing, the Good is beyond being and
nonbeing. The terms “neither” and “beyond”
here merge into a singular but contradic-tory
assertion—that something “is not” because it
superlatively “is.” Even so, the
Pseudo-Dionysius still attempts to make a
distinction be- tween the divine concept of the
Good and the demonic concept of evil.  Evil, the
author notes, “has a greater nonexistence”
vis-à-vis the Good than does nonbeing. A group
of terms are put into play here, which we can
simply diagram as in fi  gure 1. One
interpretation, in line with ortho- doxy,
would be that while the concept of the divine
begins with negation, it culminates in an
affirmation. By contrast, the concept of the
demonic begins with a minimal affirmation
(e.g., that evil names something), but then
moves towards a full negation (including the
negation of being and nonbeing). The Good
encompasses both being and nonbeing, and is
there-fore transcendent, while evil
repudiates both being and nonbeing, and is
therefore “descendent,” or perhaps, a
“demonic descendence.” Nonbeing is still
encompassed within the superlative divine
nature, and indeed it must, since by defi  nition
the divine (the One, the Good, Life, Wisdom) is  a
fi rst principle, beyond and outside of which
there is nothing more and  nothing higher. The
divine is, in this sense, a pure
interiority—everything and all things are
accounted for within the ambit of the
superlative life of the divine. What of the
demonic, then? If, as the Pseudo-Dionysius

  superlative life 53 suggests, evil has
“greater nonexistence” than nonbeing, and if
non being  still lies within the domain of the
divine, then would not evil have to  be a
non-ontological nonbeing, a negation without
reserve, an absolute  negation ?  If  t h e  di v in e  s u
p e r l a t i v e  l if e  i s  a  p ur e  in t e ri o ri t y ,  t h e n  w o ul
d   not evil have to be a pure exteriority? But
surely this only leads to more 
contradictions—an exteriority without
interiority, a negation without as- sertion,
and so on. Again, another turn: is not this dream
of a pure exte-riority also that of mystical
theology itself, with its poetic evocations of
a divine “life beyond life”? This is the dream of
a positivity that is so great that it appears
only as negation, a something which by its very
sublimity appears only as nothing. What
appears as empty is really the most
sub-stantial. Mystical theology is
predicated on this stylistic approach—what
begins in shadows and nothing is soon revealed
to be a light beyond all lights. The
Pseudo-Dionysius defi  nitely works in this
tradition, but there  are as many passages that
simply end with shadows and darkness as there
are passages that lead to transcendent light.
The rather rigorous demands of the
Pseudo-Dionysius’ concept of evil
continually place it in relation to the equally
challenging demands of the concept of the
divine. Despite the requirements of
orthodoxy, they are never as far apart as the
author presents them. This is especially the
case in regards to the concept of superlative
life.  As we’ve seen, the Pseudo-Dionysius
intimates a divine life beyond the
naturalistic, creaturely life, a
transcendent Life vis-à-vis the living. This
is most often characterized in the processual
and pervasive nature of the divine. But,
whereas the superlative life of the divine is at
once processual and “preexistent,” pervasive
and transcendent, the concept of evil that the
Pseudo-Dionysius presents is also an
admixture of an ontological founda-tion and an
assertion of something processual,
distributive, and pervasive. There is a
difference in our reading here, though it is not
the one that the Pseudo-Dionysius would like to
present. That difference lies in the
tem-porality, processuality, and
productivity of the divine versus the demonic.
Whereas the superlative life of the divine is a
site of pure excess and super-abundance (never
“running out” or fully expending itself),
there is perhaps another kind of superlative
life—that of the demonic—that does not fol-low
the oppositions of mysticism (where the
negative is followed by the af-fi rmative), but
which, instead, follows a different logic.
That logic is one of  productive negativity, in
which each assertion of negation actually
germi-nates another, further negation. In The
Divine Names , this most often has  the form of
“not- x . . . not-not- x . . . etc.” Thus evil is the
negation of being,  and also the negation of the
negation of being (nonbeing), and so on. This 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    69
    </p></div><p>
    
 54 chapter two productive negativity is thus
counterpoised to the negative productivity of 
the divine (where negation produces a concept
of affirmation, mediated by the negation,
often taking the form of “not- x = y,” where y is
defi  ned in  purely equivocal terms). While the
superlative life of the divine is “nothing” by
virtue of its  superabundance and excess (it is
literally “no thing,” has no bounds spa- tially
or temporally), the more shadowy superlative
life of the demonic is “nothing” in a different
way, by virtue of a negative transcendence,
always pointing to a negation beyond all
negation, a nothing without reserve, an
absolute negation. Note that both of these are
conceptual fantasies—one of being able to
think that which is by defi  nition unthinkable,
the other of  a pure exteriority, the absolutely
unthinkable. And both reveal important
structures of contradiction that are at the
heart of any ontology surround-ing Life and the
living. A brief summary is in order: In The
Divine Names , the Pseudo-  Dionysius presents
us with the components of the concept of
“superlative  life.” This begins from a
negative-theological assertion of a
life-beyond-life, or really, a “Life” beyond
all instances of the living, a superlative life
that is characterized by its being (i)
transcendently immanent, (ii) generous or
superabundant, and (iii) pervasive or
distributive. But this life-beyond-life,
lying as it does beyond any particular instance
of the living, must be thought of as necessarily
preceding any and all instances of the
living—in s h o rt ,  th e  s u p e r la ti v e  lif e  m us t  b e 
th e  “ Pr ee xis t en t , ”  a  kin d  o f  lif e  tha t  is
ontologically prior to all instances of life,
and, as ontologically prior, which grounds
them and conditions them as well. This is the
“Preexistent Positivity” at the center of the
superlative life concept. This Preexistent
Positivity is, for the Pseudo-Dionysius,
necessary in  order to condition the very
possibility of life—as transcendentally
beyond, as generously productive, and as
distributive emanation. But we also saw that
the Pseudo-Dionysius inadvertently doubles
back on all this positiv-ity and affirmation in
his short meditation on evil. Here the language
of negative theology enters the picture, and
the two kinds of “nothing” (de-monic and
divine) end up highlighting the
contradictions in the transcen-dent concept
of superlative life. At the core of the
meditations on life is a problem of logic. In the
mystical works of the Pseudo-Dionysius we see
an ontological prob- lematic and a vitalist
problematic being formulated, both of which
culmi-nate in the concept of superlative life.
The ontological problematic is that of the
transcendent: how to think that which is by defi 
nition beyond all

  superlative life 55 possible thought? The
Pseudo-Dionysius suggests that only a
negative the- ology ( via negativa , the
apophatic way) can adequately address this
prob- lem. The negation employed here is
neither that of privation nor of opposi- tion,
but rather a superlative negation, which, in
its very act of negation, is a transcendent
“nothing” that lies beyond everything. But
this ontological problematic is, for the
Pseudo-Dionysius, indelibly  tied to another
problematic that we can call vitalist (using
the term in its philosophical sense). The
question of the divine nature is not simply that
of its being as such; rather, the question of
what the divine is hinges on what it does. For the
Pseudo-Dionysius, the being of the divine is
insepa-rable from its processuality and
dynamics. In true Neoplatonic fashion, the
divine is not simply transcendent, it is
superlatively and superabun-dantly
transcendent; it has a processual and
pervasive character that is nevertheless
distinct from the temporal fi  nitude of
creaturely process and  the pervasiveness of
the living. In short, in the concept of the
divine-as-superlative, the
Pseudo-Dionysius crucially lays the
groundwork for a con-junction between the
divine as an ontological principle and the
divine as a vitalist principle. The term
“superlative life” is used here to designate
the stratifi  cations  of the divine, from the
lowest, most material level of living
creatures in  nature to the abstract principle
by which they are made alive and ani-mated, to
the processual and pervasive nature of the
divine, presented via the language of negative
theology. For the Pseudo-Dionysius, the
ontology of life is not simply split between the
living and Life, for the latter term “Life” is
itself bifurcated between a principle of
formal causation and an ever further
superlative life that is itself “beyond being
and nonbeing.” In this way,  an ontological
problematic— a negation that points to a su-
perlative affirmation— is tied to a vitalist
problematic —a superlative af- fi rmation that
is superlative by its generosity, its
processuality, and its  pervasiveness. The two
problematics that are outlined by the
Pseudo-Dionysius—  ontological and
vitalist—push the logic of negative theology
to its extreme.  A passage in the fi  nal chapter of
the Mystical Theology  gives a sense of  this
poetics of superlative negation: It [the
divine] falls neither within the predicate of
nonbeing nor of be- ing .  Exi s ting  b e ing s  d o  n o t 
kn o w  i t  as  i t  a c tuall y  i s  an d  i t  d o es  n o t  know them
as they are. There is no speaking of it, nor name
nor knowl-edge of it. Darkness and light, error
and truth—it is none of these. It is beyond
assertion and denial. We make assertions and
denials of what 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    71
    </p></div><p>
    
 56 chapter two is next to it, but never of it, for
it is both beyond every assertion, being  the
perfect and unique cause of all things, and, by
virtue of its pre-eminently simple and
absolute nature, free of every limitation,
beyond every limitation; it is also beyond
every denial. 63 A negation points to a
superlative affirmation, and a superlative
affirma- tion points to a paradoxical
“nothing” that is beyond all oppositions, all
contraries. At its limit, the superlative life
of the divine becomes abso-lutely
inaccessible, culminating in an iterative
language of refl  exive ne- g a t i o n  ( w o rt h y  o f  t h e 
li t e r ary  w o r d p l a y  o f  Alfr e d  J arry  o r  S am u e l  B e c
k -ett). The strange life of the divine is not
even accessible negatively via its
manifestations or theophanies, for it is
“beyond assertion and denial.” What results is
a tension within the concept of the
superlative, a tension between a concept of the
superlative as “beyond” or transcendent, and a
concept of the superlative as “within” or
immanent. In the works of the
Pseudo-Dionysius, this tension is just below
the surface; it becomes more exp li ci t in th e w or
k of Eri ugena—a reader an d transla tor of th e
Pseudo-Dionysius—who provides the concept of
superlative life with a newfound rigor and
suggests that superlative life must be thought
as actually equiva-lent to nihil . 2.5
SUPERLATIVE LIFE II: ERIUGENA The basic idea of
negative theology—that the divine is, by defi 
nition, that  which transcends thought—has a
great appeal, for it could be read as an affirma
ti on of fai th o v er reason, th eo l ogy o v er p hil
osop h y ( an d i t w o ul d be taken up again centuries
later by Aquinas in his own glosses on the
relation between theology and philosophy).
But there is another tradition infl uenced by
the Pseudo-Dionysius’ works, one that was not
so quick to  turn negation into affirmation,
philosophy into theology. One example in this
regard is the ninth-century philosopher John
Scottus Eriugena, whose major work is known as
the Periphyseon , or “The Divisions of Nature.”
64 Historically Eriugena is identifi  ed with
the height of the Carolingian  Renaissance,
which fostered cultural and intellectual
development as key elements of an expanding
empire (working during the reign of
Char-lemagne, Eriugena was also present at the
court of Charles the Bald). Hav-ing studied in
an Irish monastery, Eriugena was familiar with
the work of prominent intellectuals such as
Alcuin of York, and he would become involved in a
number of debates and controversies happening
at the time. In the mid ninth century, one such
debate concerned the idea of pre-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    72
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 57 destination (that is,
whether the divine will is constrained by
divine ends).  Eriugena was asked to intervene
in this debate by the bishop of Rheims. The work
he produced— De Praedestinatione —did little
to resolve the de- bate, and in fact led to
charges of heresy against him. Despite this,
around  858, Eriugena was asked by the king to
produce a translation of the Pseudo-Dionysius
from the Greek into Latin (he also translated
other authors, in-cluding Maximus Confessor
and Gregory of Nyssa). These translations
would prove to be deeply infl  uential on
Eriugena, not only in terms of their mystical
content, but—especially in the case of the
Pseudo-Dionysius—in their exploration of
negative theology, and the “darkness
mysticism” with w hi c h  i t  w as  o ft e n  alli e d.  T h us 
i t  is  n o  s urp ris e  t o  fi  nd that Eriugena’s 
writings abound with references to the via
negativa : “Affirmation is less  capable than
negation of signifying the ineffable essence
of God, seeing  that by the former one among the
created attributes is transferred to the
Creator, whereas by the latter the Creator is
conceived in Himself beyond every creature.”
65 Or again: “For there is more truth in saying
that God  is not any of the things that are
predicated of Him than in saying that  He is.”66 S
o m e t i m e  a r o u n d  8 6 2 – 6 6  E r i u g e n a  c o m p o s e d  t h e  w o
r k  h e  i s  n o w   mostly known for, the Periphyseon .
It occupies some four books, and takes  the form
of a dialogue between a teacher (the
“Nutritor”) and student (the “Alumnus”). The
text became somewhat notorious for what were
regarded as its heretical claims—for
instance, that the divine nature was
imma-nently “in” all things, or that God was
identical to Natura —and later  thinkers would
associate the Periphyseon  with pantheism,
though the text  itself never uses this term. As a
result, the Periphyseon  was included in  the
official condemnations by the Church in 1050,
1059, 1210, and 1225; at the center of the
controversy surrounding the Periphyseon  was
whether it  had infl  uenced later heretical
sects such as the Albigensians, or authors  such
as Amaury of Bene and David of Dinant. 67 Several
manuscripts of the Periphyseon  e x i s t ,  a n d  e a c h 
d i f f e r s  f r o m   the others, as Eriugena himself,
or a student of Eriugena’s, made exten-sive
annotations, corrections, and edits to the
main text. Thus, when the Periphyseon  was
published in 1865 as part of the Patrologia
Latina  series, a  defi nitive edition still did
not exist. Modern scholarship has helped to
elu- cidate the genealogy of the manuscripts
and their changes, and today there two editions
of the work—one by I. P. Sheldon-Williams and
John O’Meara (published by the Dublin
Institute for Advanced Studies), and another,
per-haps defi  nitive edition by Édouard
Jeauneau (published by the Pontifi  cal 
Institute for Medieval Studies). 68 Secondary

resurgence of in terest in n ega ti v e th eo l ogy 
and its relation to continental philosophy.69
2.5.1 Negation in the PERIPHYSEON One of the
central concepts of the Periphyseon  is  tha t  o f 
“N a ture ”  ( na- tura). But by natura  Eriugena
does not mean the natural or biological  world.
Natura  encompasses this, as later passages in
the Periphyseon  on  natural philosophy
illustrate, but natura  i s  a l s o  m o r e  t h a n  t h i s .  I
n  t h e   opening passages of book 1, natura  is defi 
ned simply as “all that which are  and which are
not” ( quae sunt et quae non sunt ).70 On this
level natura   appears to be Eriugena’s most
basic ontological term. Natura  is both the 
natural world, and the “nature” or essence of
something. But natura  is  also defi  ned as all
that can be thought, since “nothing at all can
come into  our thought that would not fall under
this term.”71 Thus natura  seems to  be at once the
world “out there,” thought “in here,” and the
existence or non- existence that runs through
world and thought. Eriugena’s concept  of
natura  is, in a sense, the conjunction of these
three elements—world,  thought, and being.
Eriugena states that there are four
“divisions” of natura , which are in- troduced
early on in book 1, and which can be simply listed
as follows: That which creates and is not
created (God or “Universal Nature”); that
which creates and is created (Intellect,
Primordial Causes); that which does not create
and is created (the natural world, creatures);
and that which does not create and is not created
(God or “Universal Nature”). As is evident,
Eriugena stresses the role of creation and
production in the divisions of natura . The
dialectical pairings between “created” and
“uncreated” serve  to establish a number of
relationships: the fi  rst division is the
opposite of  the third division, and the second
the opposite of the fourth. In addition, the fi 
rst and fourth divisions are identical,
implying that the divine nature  is at once the
source and end of all things, at once the
principle of creation and production, as well
as the principle of destruction and return. 72
If the  fi rst and fourth divisions are
identical, then the second and third divisions 
are also identical as all of creation,
including the natural world and its causal
principles (described in Neoplatonic terms as
“primordial causes”). The symmetry of
Eriugena’s divisions of natura  are that four
divisions be- come two (the divine nature and
creation), and two divisions become one (all
things being a part of and return to a single
natura ). This dialectics of creation and
destruction, affirmation and negation, 
implies that being and nonbeing are the most
basic aspects of natura . This 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    74
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 59 is developed further by
Eriugena in what he terms the “fi  ve modes of
being  and nonbeing,” which we can briefl  y
summarize here. The fi  rst mode is  ontological:
All that can be sensed or understood exists,
while that which  eludes sense and intellect
does not exist.73 That which does not exist is 
taken not in the privative but in the absolute
sense. Following this is the  second mode, which
is categorical. In a Neoplatonic vein, this
involves af-fi rmations and negations of lower
or higher orders of being, in a similarly 
dialectical fashion (e.g., the affirmation of
a higher order implies the nega-tion of a lower
order, the affirmation of a lower order is the
negation of a higher order). 74 This leads to a
third mode, which follows a broadly Greek 
orientation: being is actual, and nonbeing is
potential; created effects ex- ist, while that
which is not yet or hypothetically existent in
matter or form, time or place does not exist. 75
This in turn leads to a formal mode, in  which
those things that can be contemplated by the
intellect exist, while th ose  things  tha t  chang
e ,  co m e  in t o  be ing,  o r  p ass  a w a y ,  do  n o t  exis t. 76 
And this opens onto the fi  nal mode of being and
nonbeing, which is doc- trinal: humankind,
which through the Fall has lost its originary
divine nature, does not exist, and only when it
is reunited with its divine source can it truly
be said to exist. Eriugena’s Periphyseon  is
dominated by this framework—the divisions  of
natura  and the modes of being and nonbeing. Both
axes—that of natura   and that of being (
esse)—are not simply static grids that lie
forever beyond  the ambit of human reason.
Instead, Eriugena stresses the dynamics that
drive each framework—creation/destruction
in natura  and being/non-  being in esse . These
two frameworks, of “Nature” and “Being,”
intersect  in some common, dynamic principle
that courses through and drives their  states.
In the Periphyseon , Eriugena refers to this
dynamic principle in broad,  superlative
strokes, as the “life of the world” ( mundi uitam
), as “life- through-itself” ( se ipsam uita ),
or, evocatively, as “Universal Life” ( gener-
alissima uita ): For as there is no body which is
not contained within its proper spe- cies, so
there is no species which is not controlled by
the power of some life ( uitae ). Therefore, if
all bodies which are naturally constituted are 
governed by some species of life ( specie uitae
), and every species seeks  its own genus while
every genus takes its origin from universal
sub-stance, it must be that every species of
life which contains the numer-ousness of the
various bodies returns to an universal life (
generalissi- mam quandam uitam ), by
participation in which it is a species. 77

 60 chapter two W e ha v e been suggesting tha t this
dynami c prin ci p l e , also fo un d in th e 
Pseudo-Dionysius, serves as the foundation
for thinking about a concept of “Life,” or, more
specifi  cally , of a superlative life that is, in
the case of  the Dionysian and Eriugenan works,
intimately associated with the divine.  Not
only do we see a distinction between natural,
creatural life (the living) and a transcendent
principle of life (Life), but Eriugena, like
the Pseudo-Dionysius before him, will go
further , and describe this life-beyond-life,
this superlative life, in a way that suggests
that it is at once excess, gen-erosity, and
pervasiveness. In short, Eriugena lays the
groundwork for a concept of superlative life
that is a conjunction of natura  and esse . For
Eriugena, natura  applies as much to that which
can be thought as  well as that which cannot be
thought; even nonbeing and the un-thought are
encompassed within natura  (albeit
negatively). Eriugena glosses this by 
suggesting that “all that is” are those things
that can possibly be sensed or intuited by the
intellect. By contrast, “all that is not” are
those things that, by their nature, transcend
sense and intellect. This last, negative defi
nition of natura  implies that it encompasses
both the natural and su- pernatural domains.
And immediately questions arise as to the
relation between the natural and
supernatural, within this overarching
concept of natura : is God also subsumed within
natura ? Are God and natura  identi- cal? These
and other questions regarding the so-called
pantheist readings of the Periphyseon  will
concern us more in later sections. For our pur-
poses here, however, what is important to note
is that Eriugena’s concept of natura  not only
encompasses the natural and supernatural, but
in so  doing it makes room for a negative
ontology, or that which by defi  nition  cannot be
thought. This negative ontology will be
crucial, as we will see, for  Eriugena’s
development of a concept of superlative life
that is related  to nihil . 2.5.2 The QUAESTIO  DE
NIHILO : On Nothing As both a translator and
careful reader of the Pseudo-Dionysius,
Eriugena further develops some key concepts
from the Corpus Areopagiticum .  But there are
important differences between them as well.
Whereas the Pseudo-Dionysius establishes a
relationship between a mystical ontology of
superlative negation and a “vitalist”
ontology of superlative excess and
generosity, Eriugena is not so quick to affirm
the divine life-beyond-life in this way. In a
sense, the stylistic choices determine much
about each thinker’s method. Whereas the
Pseudo-Dionysius will prefer the more poetic
mode of mystical affirmation, Eriugena’s
Periphyseon  employs the 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    76
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 61 dialogue format as a means
of highlighting a number of ambiguities, par-
ticularly surrounding the transcendence and
immanence of the divine nature. This is,
perhaps, most evident in the lengthy
discussion on “noth-ing” ( nihil )  in  b o o k  3 ,  o ft
e n  r e f e rr e d  t o  as  th e  quaestio de nihilo . Here 
the method of negation employed by the
Pseudo-Dionysius is pushed to its extreme, to
the point where one must affirm negation itself
. As a method,  negation in the Periphyseon  does
not always end on a note of affirmation; 
instead, the link between “negation” and
“life” that was implicit in the
Pseudo-Dionysius’ works is now made explicit.
78 Recall that the tension inherent in the
Pseudo-Dionysius was how  to correlate, on the
one hand, a conception of the divine-as-life
(the life-  beyond-life) based on generosity,
excess, and pervasiveness, with a con- ception
of the divine-as-nothing—not in the privative
sense, but in the superlative, superabundant,
supernatural sense. We have used the term
“superlative life” to denote this tension
between the dynamic and the static, excess and
totality, immanence and transcendence. More
often than not, the note on which the
Pseudo-Dionysius ends is one of  affirmation—
not only of the superlative nature of the divine
itself, but also of the con- tradictions
inherent in that superlative nature—which, in
being contradic-tory, force a methodological
shift from philosophy to poetry or mysticism.
The affirmation in the Pseudo-Dionysius’
mystical theology is thus a double 
affirmation—an affirmation both of the divine
nature (as super- lative), and an affirmation
of its inherent contradictions (following
from its superlativeness). The
Pseudo-Dionysius denies the adequacy of
positive theology (of the sort “God is x ”), and
offers an alternative method of nega- tive
theology (of the sort “God is not- x”), but this
in turn has as its goal  a more superior
affirmation, an affirmation of absolute
transcendence, of the “beyond” of the divine,
fi  lled with contradictions and enigmas. What 
the Pseudo- Dionysius offers, then, is an
affirmative negation  by way of  mystical
theology. Eriugena-the-theologian never
denies this superlative aspect of the  divine.
But the twists and turns of the conversation in
the Periphyseon   don’t always lead so directly
to this Dionysian affirmative negation. By
contrast, Eriugena-the-philosopher,
especially in the quaestio de nihilo ,  will
focus less on the Dionysian affirmative
negation, and more on the absolute limits of the
negative in negative theology—that is, on a
negative negation . In short, by pushing the
tension-fi  lled relation between Life (as 
superlative generosity) and negation (as
superlative nothingness) to its ex-treme,
what results is a question concerning logic and
thought itself. We are getting ahead of
ourselves here, but what we will see in the

 62 chapter two de nihilo  is a concept of Life that
is not just related to negation, but a con- cept
of Life that is related to, even isomorphic
with, the logic of contradic- tion, a logic that
stems from the extended discussion on
“nothing” in the Periphyseon . Let us, as if on a
casual walk, proceed methodically through
this dis- cussion, highlighting specifi  c
points. As pointed out, the quaestio de ni- hilo
occupies a considerable portion of book 3 of the
Periphyseon . 79 While  Eriugena does discuss
the concept of nihil  elsewhere, this
represents the  most sustained and detailed
discussion of the topic in the work as a whole. 
Again, because the Periphyseon  is written in a
dialogue format, this en- ables Eriugena to
utilize the conversants—a teacher or Nutritor
and a stu-dent or Alumnus—in a variety of ways.
The quaestio de nihilo  can broadly  be broken up
into an overarching question—“how can
something come  from nothing?”—and, following
this, three replies follow in sequence. Each
reply has, nested within it, sub-questions and
sub-replies that further clarify or probe into
the nuances of the main question. A brief
outline of the quaestio de nihilo  will serve as a
guide for our reading: The quaestio de nihilo 
(Periphyseon  III): • Q: How can something come
from nothing? • A1 (nihil  as the cause of
something from nothing) • Q1-a (on nihil  as
privation) • A1-a (on nihil  as both cause and
privation) • A2 (nihil  as both eternal and
temporal) • Q2-a (on contradiction in the
divine) • Q2-b / A2-b (on diversity in unity; on
harmony) • Q2-c / A2-c (on temporality and
eternity) • A2-a (the divine as both eternal and
made) • A3 (nihil  as contradiction) • Q3-a (on
nihil  as contradiction and shadow) • Q3-b / A3-b
(on intermediaries— logos —as contradictory)
• First Dilemma (on identity) • Second Dilemma
(on totality) • A3-a (on nihil  as the divine
inaccessible) Let us fi  rst begin with the
question, posed by the Alumnus, which frames 
the entire discussion on nihil . After speaking
about the relation between  Creator and
creation in the Neoplatonic vocabulary of
“participation,” the  Alumnus asks how a
creating source is able to make something out of
nothing:

  superlative life 63 But when I hear or say that
the Divine Goodness created all things out  of
nothing I do not understand what is signifi  ed by
that name, ‘Noth- ing’ ( nihil ), whether the
privation of all essence or substance or acci-
dent, or the excellence of the divine
superessentiality.80 A rhetorical question,
perhaps, for one would not expect a doctrine of
the  divine as privation or lack to develop from
this question. Nevertheless, the Alumnus
poses what would become the standard
philosophical problem-atic concerning
causality as it was inherited from the Greeks:
given that causality structures much of our
understanding about the world, must we suppose
an originary or fi  rst cause? This idea of a fi  rst
cause can in turn  be understood in several ways:
either as a temporally fi  rst cause, or as an 
abstract, transcendent principle of
causality that is necessary in order to think in
terms of cause at all. Whatever the case, such a
fi  rst cause points  to something before or
outside this cause-of-causes. Hence the
Alumnus’ appeal to the scriptural notion of
creation-out-of-nothing. We see that
immediately the Alumnus points to two
possibilities that  the Pseudo-Dionysius had
also articulated: that this “nothing” that is
be- fore or outside of the principle of cause can
either be privative (that which lacks
causality) or superlative (that which is
beyond causality). In the fi  rst  reply given,
the Alumnus further articulates the question,
this time in  terms of being and nonbeing. As the
Alumnus notes, it would seem that “not-being is
predicated of the superessential for no other
reason than that true reason does not allow it to
be numbered among the things that are be-cause
it is understood to be beyond all things that are
and that are not.” 81 The Nutritor’s fi  rst reply
is to say that nihil  in this sense does indeed 
mean privation, but not privation in terms of
lack or incompleteness. Rather, the privation
at issue is the privation of the essence of a
thing: For that word “Nothing” is taken to mean
not some matter, not a cer- tain cause of
existing things, not anything that went before
or occurred of which the establishment of
things was a consequence, not some-thing
coessential or coeternal with God, nor
something apart from God subsisting on its own
or on another from which God took as it were a kind
of material from which to construct the world;
but it is the name for the total privation of the
whole essence and, to speak more accurately, it
is the word for the absence of the whole of
essence. 82 What nihil  is in this sense is not the
divine nature itself, but the way in  which the
divine nature governs the conditions of
existence of a thing. 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    79
    </p></div><p>
    
 64 chapter two In this case, nihil  is not simply
the lack of existence of a thing (that is,  the
lack of actual existence but not of potential
existence), but the ab- sence of its conditions
of existing, of its very essence. Thus nihil 
names  not just privation as the lack of
existence, but the absolute, essential ab-
sence of  existence—absolute non-existence,
“total privation.” And here  we see something
that will recur in each of the Nutritor’s
replies concern-ing nihil . If we follow the
Nutritor’s train of thought, nihil  as absolute 
non- existence is something that can be
identifi  ed only a posteriori , after a  thing
exists or has ceased to exist, for otherwise its
non-existence would not be absolute, only
accidental and incidental. Absolute
non-existence implies that its very
possibility, its very conditions, cannot be
thought. Absolute non-existence is never
something that one can think in its
non-existence, as it were. Thus, in the fi  rst
reply, where nihil  is taken to be the  absolute
non-existence of a thing, we reach a fi  rst limit
of thought con- cerning the superlative. While
the Alumnus wants to say that the divine is nihil 
due to its superlatively transcendent nature
(more in line with the  Pseudo- Dionysius), the
Nutritor’s fi  rst reply is simply that nihil 
means  what it says—absolute non-existence,
total privation. Like all of the Nutritor’s
replies, this one leaves the more
inexperienced  Alumnus puzzled and disturbed
by “dark clouds” of doubt (the motifs of  which we
will consider below). If nihil  is simply
absolute non-existence,  then how do we connect
this nebulous zone of nothingness to our under-
standing of the divine nature as superlative,
generous, and an excessive fl owing-forth? On
the one hand, nihil  as absolute non-existence
seems a  bit like infi  nity or
eternity—something vast, boundless, and
empty. But  on the other hand, the divine nature,
as superlative, is also clearly defi  ned  in
terms of its creative, generative, germinal
capacity—always fl  owing  outward, emanating
from a central source, down to the most lowly,
inert stone. This leads the Alumnus to ask more
directly about the act of cre-ation itself: For
if all things that are, are eternal in the
creative Wisdom, how are  they made out of
nothing? For how can that be eternal which
before it was made was not, or how can that which
begins to be in time and w i t h  t i m e  b e  i n  e t e r n i t y ? 
F o r  n o t h i n g  t h a t  p a r t i c i p a t e s  i n  e t e r n i t y 
either begins to be or desists from being,
whereas that which was not and begins to be will
of necessity desist from being what it is. For
nothing that is not without a beginning can be
without an end. Therefore I cannot discover how
these opinions do not contradict one another.

  superlative life 65 This dialectic between
that which is made ( facta ) and that which is
eter- nal (aeterna ) dominates the second reply
on nihil . The Alumnus proposes  a choice: either
the divine nature is total and static—and thus
defi  ned by  being eternal—or the divine is
partial and dynamic—and thus defi  ned  by the
processes of actuality and actualization.
This second reply has, nested within it, two
sub-questions and sub-  replies. In the fi  rst
sub-question, the Alumnus asks how
contradictory  things can come from the divine
nature, which is defi  ned as being su-
perlative, simple, and non-contradictory.
The Nutritor readily admits the  p e r p l e x i n g  n a t
u r e  o f  t h e  p r o b l e m .  H o w ,  h e  n o t e s ,  “ c o u l d  t h e  u n f
o r m e d  come from the Form of all, the variable and
mutable from Him Who is  immutable and
invariable . . . that which admits intervals of
places and  times and quantities from Him Who is
not extended by intervals of places and times . .
. the corruptible from the Incorruptible, the
composite from the Simple, and other
objections of that sort . . .” 84 The Nutritor’s
reply involves the use of several analogies,
including  that of music and cosmology. These
hinge on the concept of harmony, and  harmony
achieved, in particular, through
diversity-in-unity and  difference-
in-identity. Just as a single musical melody
consists of a multiplicity of sounds, and just
as the unity of the cosmos consists of a 
multiplicity of  bodies, so does the
superlative divine nature operate through
this har-monic balance of unity and diversity.
This follows down through all the l e v e l s  o f  t h e  n
a t u r a l  w o r l d ,  f o r ,  a s  t h e  N u t r i t o r  a r g u e s ,  “ t h e 
b e a u t y  o f  the whole established universe
consists of a marvelous harmony of like and
unlike in which the diverse genera and various
species and the dif-ferent orders of
substances and accidents are composed into an
ineffable unity.” 85 Philosophically
speaking, the Nutritor’s reply does more to
reify the  question than to answer it. For any
reference to harmony and order must in turn
appeal to a source of that harmony or order, and
this brings us back again to an inaccessible,
superlative kind of law or governance. The
arti-fi ce of music, like the artifi  ce of the
cosmos, must have an Artifi  cer, or at  least some
transcendent principle by which celestial and
musical harmony is made possible. However,
this principle can only be posited as such,
since by defi  nition it lies outside of the ambit
of human thoughts. But already  we are seeing a
concept of the superlative life take shape
around the theme of nihil . In the Nutritor’s
second reply, we can see that it is the exception 
of the superlative divine to not only govern
harmonic order, but, in so do-ing, to function
through contradiction (unity-diversity,
form-formless, and so on).

    81
    </p></div><p>
    
 66 chapter two This leads to a second
sub-question, which the Alumnus poses with 
rather crafty specifi  city. The Alumnus fi  rst
begins by making a crucial  distinction, one
that has, up until this time, not been made: that
when  we speak of “cause” we can speak of either
chronological or ontological causality. In a
proto-Humean vein, the Alumnus notes that
temporal or chronological causality need not
imply an ontologically necessary causal-ity,
since “it is not in time that formlessness
precedes form but in the natural order in which
the cause comes before the effect.” 86 While one
can  debate whether or how the divine nature
creates and makes things chrono-logically in
time, this cannot be the essence of the divine
nature—it must also be causal in an
ontologically necessary sense, as that
concept without which one cannot think
causation itself. But the Nutritor’s previous
examples (music, the cosmos, the natural 
world) seem to point more to the contingent,
chronological type of cau-sality. How can
these two types of causality coexist in one
superlative, divine nature? Hence the
Alumnus’ second sub-question, which we can
quote at length: But now I hear differently from
you things which disturb me greatly  and turn me
reluctantly from what I hitherto fi  rmly held to
be true as  I thought. For the present line of
reasoning, as I think, seeks to teach nothing
else but that those things which I used to think
were made from nothing and were certainly not
eternal . . . are at the same time eternal and
made, which I think to be surely a
contradiction, and rea-sonably so . . . For
things that are eternal never begin to be, never
cease to subsist, and there was not a time when
they were not, because they always were; but
things which are made have received a beginning
of their making—for they began to be—because
there was a time when they were not, and they will
lose the being which they began to pos-sess.
For, if right reason be consulted, nothing
which begins in time to be is permitted to endure
for ever, but it is necessary that it should tend
towards the end in which that which has a
beginning of its being in time is compelled to
perish. 87 Perhaps the Almnus is truly shaken by
uncertainty and confusion; per- haps he senses
a real and profound lacuna in the Nutritor’s
thinking and is furtively undermining it.
Whatever the case, the Alumnus here raises the
discussion to another level. The issue is no
longer simply whether creation is made or
eternal, but how such a fundamental
contradiction can exist within the divine
nature itself.
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    82
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 67 This contradiction exists
on three levels. The fi  rst is on the level of 
temporality: that which is made presupposes a
beginning, and that which  has a beginning
cannot be eternal. The second level is that of
teleology: that which is made also has an end,
either as cessation or as fulfi  llment,  and
therefore cannot be eternal. And the third
level is that of mereology: that which is made
implies the production not just of parts but of
relations between them, the order and
“harmony” of which constitutes a unity. But
this implies a dynamical, emerging capacity of
that which has not always existed, and is
therefore not eternal. In short, the Alumnus’
two sub- questions concerning nihil  d o v e t a i l  o
n  t h i s  i s s u e  o f  t h e  c o n t r a d i c - tion between the
made and the eternal—that is, on a problematic
that the  Alumnus maintains as a philosophical
problematic. This is important to note
because, immediately following this, the dis-
cussion reaches a dramatic pitch—the Nutritor
does not have an immedi-ate, ready-made reply.
Instead, he notes the difficulty of the
question and enjoins the Alumnus to meditate
and say a prayer with him so that they may be able
to continue and discover an adequate answer—if
ever there was a paradigmatic “prayer to
philosophy,” this would surely be it. What the
Nutritor comes up with—after the prayer—is
perhaps unsur- prising. It is mathematics—in
particular, the theory of numbers, as it was 
understood by Eriugena in the ninth century. If
treated like a riddle, the Nutritor’s reply
starts to make sense. Question: what begins but
does not have an end, and yet is not subject to the
contingencies of created, natural things in
the world? Answer: number. Number, and in
particular cardi-nal numbers, begin but need
not have an end. Furthermore, particular
in-stances of counting are different, for the
Nutritor, from the abstraction of number
itself. Citing the work of Boethius on
mathematics, both the Nu-tritor and the
Alumnus agree on this basic distinction:
“Arithmetic is the science of numbers, not of
those which we count, but of those by which we
count.” 88 This, in turn presupposes a higher
principle by which number is count- able, and
which encompasses any and all possible
instances of numbering.  This is what the
Nutritor calls the Monad: [C]onsider
carefully those who affirm that unity never had
a begin- ning. If unity, which the Greeks call
the Monad, is the beginning and middle and end of
all numbers . . . it will not be one unity from
which the numbers proceed and through which
they move and another to-wards which they tend
and in which they come to an end, but one and the
same that is both beginning and middle and end.
Therefore, num-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    83
    </p></div><p>
    
 68 chapter two bers which proceed from their
beginning proceed from nowhere else  than their
end—for their beginning is not one thing and
their end an-other, but they are one and the same
unity—, and therefore it must be concluded that
if they extend to an infi  nite end their
extension must  begin from an infi  nite
beginning. But the infi  nite end of all numbers
is  unity; therefore the infi  nite beginning of
all numbers is the same. 89 The Nutritor’s
rather dizzying but articulate logic begins
from a basic dis- tinction between concrete
instances of numbering ( x n um b e r  o f  things )   and
the abstract concept of number that makes such
instances possible. We can refer to this as a
distinction between numbers and Number, the
latter providing the conditions of
possibility for rendering the former
func-tional. 90 For the Nutritor, the essence
of Number is the Monad, the Num- ber of all
possible numbers. The Monad is further
characterized by the Nutritor in a Neoplatonic
fashion: it is the emanative cause of all
numbers (instances of counting); as such, it is
simple and indivisible; it is at once universal
and multiple; it is based on abstract reason
rather than sense; and, following from this, it
is infi  nite in reason, but not in sense. 91 Thus
the Nutritor’s reply to the second
sub-question is by the anal- ogy of
mathematics—God, like the Monad, is at once
both cause and eter-nity, both having
ontological priority and proceeding to infi 
nity. When  the Alumnus persists, the Nutritor
nuances the analogy through the use of
modality: “Do you then see that the same numbers
are eternal there where they are potentially in
their cause, that is, in the Monad, but where
they are understood to be actually, there they
are made?” 92 So the Monad,  like God, is eternal
when perceived in its potentiality, and made
when it is perceived in its actuality. This
modal qualifi  cation in turn sets up a string  of
contraries that enable contradiction to be
thought: potential vs. actual, eternal vs.
made, Monad vs. numbers, Creator vs. creature,
Life vs. the liv-ing, and so on. 93 2.5.3 The
QUAESTIO  DE NIHILO : Superlative Nothing The
two preceding sub-questions—one having to do
with temporal vs. causal priority, the other
having to do with the analogy of the
Monad—dovetail into a larger reply—the
second—that the Nutritor gives. Recall that in
reply to the Alumnus’ overarching question
“how can something come from nothing ( nihil )?”
the Nutritor gave a fi  rst reply, which was that 
nihil  designated a privation, but a privation
of the essence of a thing, which  in turn implied a
notion of a divine nature that was also a fi  rst
cause. But 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    84
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 69 this only begged the
question for the Alumnus, who persisted,
questioning  the contradiction inherent in
this notion of nihil  as at once eternal and  made,
nothing and something, negative and positive.
The Nutritor’s im- portant second reply is that
if one is to think the divine nature in relation
to the concept of “nothing” or nihil , one must
affirm the contradiction  of the world being
both eternal and made: “the things that are
eternal are not other than the things that are
made but the same things are at once both eternal
( aeterna ) and made ( facta ).” 94 In his second
reply, the Nutritor  does not try to quell the
anxieties surrounding contradiction;
indeed, he agrees with the Alumnus that it is
contradictory to think of something produced
from n o thing. Quo ting n um ero us passages from
scri pture , th e Nutritor’s reply is that the
concept of the divine nature, as superlative,
entails a necessary affirmation of
contradiction. 95 The contradiction be- tween
the world-as-made and the world-as-eternal
is, thus, only an appar-ent contradiction: Let
us, then, believe and, so far as it is given us,
contemplate with the  keenness of our mind how
all things visible and invisible, eternal and
temporal, and the eternal itself and time
itself, and places and exten-sions and all
things which are spoken of as substance and
accident, and, to speak generally, whatever
the totality of the whole creature contains,
are at the same time eternal and made in the only
begotten Word of God, and that in them neither
does their eternity precede their making nor
their making precede their eternity. For in the
dispensa-tion of the Word their eternity is
made and their making eternal. For even all
things which are seen to arise through
generation at times and places in the order of
the centuries were made all together and at once
eternally in the World of God. 96 The divine
nature, as superlative, is overfl  owing
generosity or production,  and yet still
“nothing.” The natural world is at once made or
produced,  and yet, by being made, it also
participates in the eternal and infi  nite. The 
concept of the divine superlative is, in a
sense, based on an affirmation of a
contradiction: that God, like Number, is at
once transcendent to and im-manent within all
things: If, then, God is prior to the universe
which He established for no other  reason than
the sole fact that He is the Cause while it is the
caused, and every caused thing always subsists
in its cause . . . then the uni-verse, since it is
caused, that is, participates in its cause, is
eternal in 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    85
    </p></div><p>
    
 70 chapter two its cause. Therefore it is
evident that the universe of the whole creation 
is eternal in the Word of God.97 While this is not
quite an assertion of pantheism—a term that
was, more- over, unknown to Medieval
philosophers—the Nutritor is nevertheless
pushed forward by the questions of the Alumnus
into a consideration of the two contradictory
meanings of nihil : nihil  as privation and nihil 
as  excess. Thus, while the Nutritor’s second
reply does offer a way of thinking  the
contradiction, what still remains is this
troubling concept of nihil .  Simplifying
things greatly, we can see that the quaestio de
nihilo  sets up  a relationship between three
elements: fi  r s t ,  a  di vin e  n a tur e  th a t  i s  d e - fi
ned by its being superlative and a fi  rst cause;
second, the created, natural  world that fl  ows
forth from the superlative divine nature; and
third, an am- biguous state before or outside of
creation that can only be characterized
through the language of negation (as nihil ). Up
until this point, neither the  Alumnus nor the
Nutritor has addressed the relation between
these three elements. Is nihil  equivalent to
the superlative, divine nature? Or does the 
latter stand transcendently above
everything, even above “nothing”? These
relationships are brought to a head with the
question that the  Alumnus now asks: Concerning
the eternity of all things and their creation . .
. I neither  doubt nor think that you were
teaching anything else. I only inquire how all
things are at the same time eternal and made . . .
For it does not, as I think, accord with reason
that made things shall be eternal or eternal
things made. For there will seem to be no
difference between the eternity of the
Universe in the Word and its creation if
eternity is created and creation eternal. 98
The Alumnus drives this line of thought to its
logical conclusion, adding,  not without some
skepticism, a challenge to the Nutritor:
“Hence there is nothing left, as I think, but
either to respect it in complete silence in
defer-ence to its excessive profundity or for
you to begin your investigation if it seems to
you that there is anything about it to be
investigated.” 99 From one point of view, the
Alumnus is simply being thick-headed and 
stubborn, asking again the same question about
the contradictions in the divine nature. And
the Nutritor’s frustration is apparent: “I am
surprised and very much disturbed that you
should seek for reason where all reason fails,
or understanding where all understanding is
surpassed.” 100 What do 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    86
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 71 you think we’re doing
here?, is the Nutritor’s response. Of course
reason  fails, that’s the whole point. The
Nutritor chastises the Alumnus for
at-tempting to know the unknowable, but in so
doing, he backs out of a phil-osophical problem
via a religious response. But in the naiveté of
the Alumnus there is something interesting. 
Whereas before, the Alumnus was asking specifi 
cally how something  made can also be something
eternal, here the Alumnus seems to be asking 
another kind of question, a question about
contradiction itself. The Alum-nus, step by
step, pursues his questioning: “I do not ask for
the establish-ment of the universe in the World
and of its eternity, for no one can say how things
that are eternal are also made . . . But I do ask for
the reason why we are compelled to profess that
eternal things are made in the Word of God, if it
can be found.” 101 Here again we see the Alumnus
ratcheting up the discourse to a  higher level.
The question is not so much about how one can
think both the made and the eternal in a single
thought, but how one can think the divine nature
at all. “Nothing is left but to ask, not how they
are eter-nal and made, but why they are said to be
both made and eternal.” 102 We  can read the
Alumnus’ question as asking why, in the above
case of the eternal and the made, must the
contradiction be maintained? Why does
contradiction seem to be a central component of
theological—and perhaps 
philosophical—discourse itself? The
Alumnus’ question is thus really  about why
contradiction appears to be at once
unavoidable and necessary for thought to
occur. To this, the Nutritor has no direct
reply, except once again by recourse  to
scripture and mysticism (e.g., the references
to “divine ignorance”). 103  The Alumnus does
not seem to so easily accept the reply of
mysticism, and he goes even further to
articulate two logical dilemmas that
illustrate the centrality of contradiction to
theological-philosophical discourse. The fi 
rst dilemma deals with the relationship, in
Neoplatonic terms,  between the divine will or
volition and the superlative nature of the
di-vine. 104 In other words, is it so much the
nature of the divine that it cannot  not fl  ow
forth into creation? Can the superlative
divine nature not  create?  Between the
superlative nature and the divine will there
appears to be a tension. If they are the same,
then God equals creation, since the divine will
is identical to that which is willed. If they are
different, then God is not simple, since the
divine will resides outside of the superlative
nature, thus requiring another mediation. The
second dilemma is a variant on the fi  rst, and
concerns the tension  between, on the one hand,

 72 chapter two causality (being the fi  rst
cause), and, on the other hand, the superlative 
divine nature as rooted in its teleology (being
the fi  nal cause).105 The super- lative nature
as at once outfl  owing and infl  owing reveals
another, similar  tension. Does the
superlative nature of the divine imply a
predestination  or predetermination? Insofar
as the divine is an absolute cause (the cause of
all causes), does this totality imply a limit to
causality (that is, the nihil   that would seem to
be uncaused)? Such contradictions lead the
Alumnus to follow a line of thinking that  would
later be called, rightly or wrongly,
“pantheist”: But if the nature of the Divine
Goodness is one thing and what it sees  to be made
and did make, and saw and made in itself, is
another, the simplicity of the Divine Nature (
diuinae naturae ) will be broken when  there is
understood to be in it that which it is not, which
is altogether impossible. If on the other hand
the Divine Nature is not other than that of which
it sees the making in itself, but they are one and
the same nature ( natura ) whose simplicity is
inviolable and whose unity  is indivisible, it
will at once be admitted that God is all things
every-where, and wholly in the whole, and the
Maker and the made and the Seer and the seen, and
the place and the essence of all things and their
substance and their accident and, to speak
simply, everything that truly is and is not. 106
The Nutritor is quick to reply here, using the
Neoplatonic notion of inter- mediary beings
(exemplars, causes, logos ) to avoid any
implication of pure  immanence between the
superlative, divine nature and the created,
natu-ral world. But this still does not address
the concept of nihil  and the recur- rent
presence of contradictions. It seems that,
given the Alumnus’ ques-tioning, the only
avenue left open is to entertain the
possibility that nihil   is, in a sense,
equivalent to contradiction itself. It is here
that the Nutritor fi nally provides a defi 
nition of nihil , one worth quoting in its
entirety: I should believe that by that name is
signifi  ed the ineffable and incom-
prehensible and inaccessible brilliance of
the Divine Goodness which  is unknown to all
intellects whether human or angelic—for it is
super-essential and supernatural—, which
while it is contemplated in itself neither is
nor was nor shall be, for it is understood to be in
none of the things that exist because it
surpasses all things, but when, by a certain
ineffable descent into the things that are, it
is beheld by the mind’s eye, it alone is found to
be in all things, and it is and was and shall be.

  superlative life 73 Therefore so long as it is
understood to be incomprehensible by reason  of
its transcendence it is not unreasonably
called “Nothing,” but when it begins to appear
in its theophanies it is said to proceed, as it
were, out of nothing into something, and that
which is properly thought of as beyond all
essence is also properly known in all essence,
and therefore every visible and invisible
creature can be called a theophany, that is, a
divine apparition. 107 The divine nature is
nihil  in a privative sense, because what it
lacks is  the contingency of being caused and
created that would make it “some  thing.” But
then this means that the divine nature is nihil 
in a superlative  sense, since it is by virtue of
its superessential nature that it is literally
“no thing,” since it surpasses all things. The
Nutritor smooths over the contradictions of
nihil  b y  th e  in t erm ediary  l e v e ls  o f  ca usa ti o n: 
in  i ts e lf   the divine is nothing, but in others
the divine is all things; in itself, the
superlative life of the divine is nihil , in
others, it is theophany. While this  does repeat
the principles of negative theology inherited
from the Pseudo-Dionysius, what it leaves
untouched, and untouchable, is the relation
be-tween the superlative divine nature (as
generosity, as excess, as pervasive-ness) and
this “ineffable” concept of nihil . In the
quaestio de nihilo , what we see taking shape is a
concept of  Life—as divine, superlative
life—that ends up being closely associated 
with a concept of nihil  or “nothing.” The
central dynamic at work here is  that between, on
the one hand, a concept of the divine that is
superlative  positivity, and, on the other
hand, a concept of the divine that is negation,
nothing, and nihil . On the one hand, a concept of
Life that is character- ized by its generosity,
its germinality, its fl  owing forth, and, on the
other  hand, a concept of Life that is, in itself,
static, vacuous, a nothingness. In these
passages from the Periphyseon , Eriugena
provides us with a central  concept for any
ontology of life, here understood through the
concept of nihil . Beyond any particular
instance of life in the living, creatural,
natu- ral world, there is a concept of “Life”
that makes it possible to think life as
instances of the living at all. In the quaestio
de nihilo , Eriugena ventriloquizes, through
the voices  of the Alumnus and Nutritor, the
contradictions that inhere in any at-tempt to
think an ontology of life-beyond-life. The
Nutritor, in replying to the Alumnus’
questions, will more often than not opt for a
solution that involves mediation and
mysticism, with frequent references to
scriptural exegesis and the “divine
ignorance” of theology above and beyond
philoso-phy. By contrast, if we take the
perspective of the Alumnus, with his per-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

 74 chapter two sistent questioning on the level
of philosophy, it would seem that nihil  im-
plies not just an incidental, but a fundamental
connection between “life”  and “nothing.” If
life is nihil  in this sense, it would not be
because it is a  privation of some essence, but
precisely due to its excess, its generosity,
its  pervasiveness. That is, while nihil  can, in
one sense, be mediated in the  way the Nutritor
describes, in another, more furtive sense,
nihil  points to  the antinomial nature of the
divine, superlative life as “nothing.” 2.5.4
Dark Intelligible Abyss Before m oving on to
consi der this rela ti on betw een Life an d nihil 
more  closely, a fi  nal word needs to be said about
the language through which  Eriugena most often
discusses the concept of nihil . At the end of
this  lengthy defi  nition of nihil , Eriugena has
the Nutritor add that “the inac- cessible
brilliance of the celestial powers is often
called by theology dark-ness ( tenebrositas
).” 108 Throughout the quaestio de nihilo  both
the Nutri- tor and the Alumnus return again and
again to the language of shadow and darkness to
describe the absolute alterity that nihil 
represents. A good example in this regard
occurs near the beginning of the discus- sion on
nihil , where the Alumnus expresses his
hesitation: “I feel myself  to be surrounded on
all sides by the dark clouds of my thoughts (
nebulis  ualde tenebrosis cogitationum ).” 109
A bit later on, the Alumnus again ex- presses
himself in a similar way, his confusion
described as “the thick clouds of my thoughts (
tenebras densissimas cogitationum ).” 110
Here the  language of darkness is used in a rather
conventional manner, to express doubt,
uncertainty, and confusion. But in other
passages, the Alumnus uses the language of
darkness in a slightly different way, noting
that his thoughts are “daunted by the excessive
obscurity, or rather, the excessive
brightness, of the very subtle reasons that
elude me.” 111 Here darkness is  not the absence
of understanding, but its being surpassed by a
superlative kind of knowledge. What is dark and
shadowed is such because it is be-yond “vision”
altogether. This other use of darkness and
shadow is developed at greater length  in book 2
of the Periphyseon , where Eriugena discusses
the divine nature  as at once superlative
positivity and yet the nothingness of
negativity. In Eriugena’s Neoplatonic-infl 
uenced cosmology, the divine nature is split 
between its primordial causes, which, through
their generosity and ger-minality, fl  ow forth
into the world, and the divine in itself, which
main- tains its transcendence above and beyond
the world. As the Nutritor ar-gues, while the
divine in itself is supereminent, beatifi  c
light, the divine

    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 75 causes are darkness and
shadow, “waste” ( inania ) and “void” ( uacua
).112  This nebulous and dynamic realm, this
superlative life, is described as a  “dark
abyss” ( tenebrosae abyss ), or, more
strikingly, as the “dark intelli- gible abyss”
( tenebrosa abyssus intellectualis ).113 This
sort of language points to what is often
referred to as “ darkness  mysticism” in
Christian mystical writing, of which works
such as The  Cloud of Unknowing  stand out as
examples.114 Eri ugena ’ s preferen ce for  t h e  l
an gu a g e  o f  d ar kn e s s  s t an d s  in  dir e c t  c o n t r a s t  t
o  P a t r i s t i c  t h in k e r s  such as Augustine, for
whom divine knowledge was obtained through
be-atifi c vision and light. The infl  uence for
Eriugena is clearly that of the 
Pseudo-Dionysius, in particular that of The
Mystical Theology , of which  Eriugena produced
a Latin translation around 860, prior to his
writing the  Periphyseon . That translation
would be amended with commentary and  scholia by
later generations, and eventually would
become a textbook for Dionysian studies during
the high point of Scholasticism in the twelfth
century, read at the University of Paris, and
consulted by theologians such as Hugh of St.
Victor and Albert the Great. Eriugena’s own
edition of the Pseudo-Dionysius’ The Mystical
Theology shows an awareness of  the prevalence
of darkness and shadow-terms in the text. His
translation consistently employs the term
caligo  in Dionysian phrases such as “divine 
darkness” or the “darkness of unknowing,” and
tenebrae  in phrases such  as “divine shadows.”
115 Thus, on one level, the language of darkness
allows Eriugena to chart  a middle path between
the poles of either total affirmation (vision,
light, beatitude) and total negation
(silence, void, death). Darkness, shadows,
clouds, and such are not in themselves the
divine nihil , but they serve  a dual function:
they delineate the limits of thought, while
also point-ing beyond those limits to an
antinomial site that, in itself, can only be
thought in terms of contradiction. The
language of darkness allows Eri-ugena to be
able to continue to think beyond the
conventional limitations of thought—indeed,
it allows him to think the limit of thought
itself. 2.6 APOPHASIS Let us briefl  y review the
ground we’ve covered thus far. Our opening
ques-tion had to do with the possibility of an
ontology of Life—that is, a con-cept of Life
that, while thought ontologically, did not
immediately become a question of Being
(metaphysics) or God (theology). This
question led to a specifi  c dimension to the
ontology of Life—in particular, the ways in 
which life is conceptualized in terms of time.
Life is that which is defi  ned

 76 chapter two by change, by dynamic process, by
its propensity for creation and produc- tion.
Life, viewed in terms of its temporality, is
always a “superlative life.” But Life, insofar
as it is characterized by change and process, is
also not the same as the living, for it variously
serves as fi  rst cause, transcendent 
principle, and ontological necessity for the
possibility of thinking about the living.
Thus, an ontology of Life guarantees a minimal
intelligibil-ity of the living, for the
living. At the same time, however, a
distinction is maintained between Life and the
living—even in those instances in which Life is
immanently “in” the living. This minimal
distinction arises out of the temporality
specifi  c to Life and the living, be it viewed in
terms  of creation, production, emanation,
gift, or immanence. Life appears to  be at once
the fundamental cause and ontological
necessity of all possible instances of the
living, and yet this Life is itself not one of the
caused and is itself not one of those instances
of the living. In short, Life can only be thought
via those instances of the living that  Life
itself produces. And what this means is that
Life, which is conceptu-alized in terms of its
superlative temporality and its generosity,
this con-cept of Life must be thought in terms of
negation, or, as Eriugena suggests, in terms of
waste ( inania ), void ( uacua ), and nothing (
nihil ). This is a par- ticular variant on the via
negativa , the logic of negative theology
inherited  from the Pseudo-Dionysius and
extended by Eriugena. The concept of Life,  when
ontologized in terms of time, has the structure
of negative theology. 2.6.1 The Apophatic
Logic In the Pseudo-Dionysius and Eriugena, we
see the concept of life split be-tween the
natural, creaturely life of the world, and a
superlative life that, in some cases, appears
to be identical with the divine nature itself.
It is this latter, superlative life, that
remains both a limit and a necessity for
thought. Life, which grounds all possible
instances of the living, is, in it-self,
nothing. The apophatic logic provides a
framework for sustaining this contradiction,
and, in effect, synthesizing refl  ection on the
natural world  with refl  ection on the
supernatural world. We can refer to this
synthesis  simply as apophasis , the process in
which Life is ontologized via the logi- cal
framework of negative theology. But what does
it mean exactly , to employ negation in this way
to the  idea of life as superlative? One would
have to outline a logic of negative theology, an
apophatic logic in which negation always
points towards con-tradiction. In the works of
the Pseudo-Dionysius and Eriugena, we can
dis-cern an apophatic logic, which we can here
put in its simplest terms:
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    92
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 77 • If A = Life and a = the
living, then: • Defi ne A as that which
conditions a; • Defi ne A as that which is beyond
a; • A and a are always correlated in an
asymmetrical way; • A in itself is never
manifest except in instances of a; • A in itself
can only be thought in terms of a; • All thought of
A must be the thought of a plus or minus 
something; • In any given situation W in which a
is embedded, a can refer to  A only in terms of not-
A; • Any statement of not- A is likewise embedded
in a given W; • Any statement not- A implies a
universal not- W; • At its limit, not- A = not- W; •
This not- A has as its main function the turning
back upon and  annulling of every statement
about A—even those statements  concerning not-
A. • A, which is the essence of a, is in itself
nothing ( nihil ). This is not, of course, a
rigorous formalization of negative theology,
but  even so, what is evident is the way in which a
kind of furtive, subterranean notion of nihil 
is fundamental for negative theology’s
contradictory affir- mation of a pure
exteriority, a domain of pure excess and
generosity. The greatest affirmation
requires the greatest negation. It is not only
that A  can be thought—and is existent—only via
the instantiations of a , but the  very
ontological necessity and ground of a can be
thought of only as nihil . In the context of
Medieval and Scholastic thinking, this
contradiction  opens onto a set of interesting
issues. On the one hand, the ostensible
pur-pose of negative theology is to end on a note
of affirmation—even though this affirmation
can never be truly affirmative. Thinkers such
as Augus-tine provide one approach, whereby
one takes away the qualifi  ers “this” or  “that,”
leaving only a pure Platonic essence.
Augustinianism thus tends more towards the
motifs of beatitude and light. By contrast, we
have the apophatic or negative way,
represented by the Pseudo-Dionysius. Here one
employs negative terms, but this negation is
understood not to be a negation based on
privation or incompleteness, but a negation
based on that which is superlative and in excess
of all possible thought. Thus, by saying that
God is “not-Life” one is also implying that God
is “beyond-Life” or “after life.” “Not- a”
immediately becomes “more-than- a,” or even 
“other-than- a.” Negation, in this mode,
implies a “nothing” that is noth- ing by virtue
of being superlatively other than everything.
In this sense, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    93
    </p></div><p>
    
 78 chapter two the apophatic way intentionally
employs contradiction, both to deny that  there
can be any truly positive theology, and to
assert the pervasive, dis-tributive, and even
immanent existence of the superlative in all
things. For the apophatic way, the only
affirmation is the affirmation of negation,
and the only negation is one that employs
contradiction. However, at this point, an
impasse occurs, and three options are pre-
sented: (i) total silence, (ii) the poetry of
mysticism, or (iii) the logic of par- adox.
While both the Pseudo-Dionysius and Eriugena
do suggest the fi  rst  two options, it is in the
third that their works are the most intriguing.
And because of this, it is in these moments that
they also reveal the most about the ontology of
Life. This ontology takes a concept of the
divine, and comprehends it in terms of its
superlative nature. This superlative nature
is  a t  o n ce  a b s o l u t e l y  tr ans ce n d e n t  an d  y e t ,  b y 
virtu e  o f  i ts  c r ea ti v e  an d  productive
generosity, it is also pervasive and immanent.
This temporal, dynamic, processual notion of
the divine nature splits the concept of life
between a subordinate, caused, creaturely
life of the world, and a superla-tive, causing,
creating Life. This latter, while
ontologically necessary for the former,
cannot, in itself, be thought, except in
negative terms. Here the only affirmation is
negation, a negation that can never, by defi 
nition,  be superseded by affirmation. This
negation, as we’ve noted, is understood  not to
be a negation characterized by privation, but a
superlative, excessive negation, lying
beyond all possible conception. The divine or
supernatural is defi  ned as the limit of
thought, or that point at which thought cannot 
but become contradictory. 2.6.2 Negation in
Frege and Ayer It is important to note that the
poetics of darkness, nihil , and tenebrae   is
indelibly linked to the apophatic logic. There
is not, beyond the limits  of thought, simply an
arbitrary poetry of darkness—rather, what
apopha-sis shows is that darkness, nihil , and
tenebrae  are articulated through the  logic of
negation. In order to understand this, it is
necessary to make some distinctions
concerning the concept of negation itself.
This concept has had a long and complex history
within the Western philosophical tradi-tion
alone; we will limit ourselves here to three
modern distinctions, as they bear upon the
ontology of life, defi  ned in terms of negation.
Negation is a tricky affair; it is a refl  ex, an
echo, an iteration. Negation  is also a shadow;
it is always doubled by the fact that it must
minimally assert itself. To state “not- X” is to
make an affirmation (of a negation) in  the
statement itself. Furthermore, “not- X”
presupposes the prior existence 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    94
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 79 of an “ X” and thus requires,
prior to the negation, an affirmation of X 
(which is subsequently negated . . . via the
affirmation of a negation). Even  terms that are
not derived from positive terms are
compromised by a simi-lar problem (e.g., the
term “nothing” must posit or assert nothing).
In a 1919 essay simply titled “Negation,”
Gottlob Frege suggested  that conundrums like
these are indications of the untenability of
the   affirmation/negation distinction. 116
Although the distinction between   affirmation
and negation has long been a central part of
logic, for Frege  there exists no defi  nitive way
of distinguishing between them, and we  should
drop the distinction altogether as
unnecessary for logic. Much of this is also
demonstrated in our use of language: for
example,  if you believe in the existence of an
ancient, malevolent, and oozing spe-cies of
Elder deities called Shoggoths, and if I say to
you “Shoggoths don’t exist,” my negation is
redoubled by an affirmation (albeit an
affirmation of the ideal or imaginary
existence of Shoggoths). Furthermore, in
response to my statement, you may reply “Yeah,
right.” If your reply is said in a tone of
profound sarcasm, then you would have made an
affirmation that is really a negation (e.g.,
only a fool would deny the existence of
Shog-goths). Thus to make judgments based on
affirmation and negation makes little sense in
cases like these, since a statement is both
affirmation and negation, either
simultaneously, or sequentially. Despite
Frege’s recommendation, the topic of negation
was not dropped;  in an essay also titled
“Negation,” A. J. Ayer suggested that negation
need not be an absolute concept; more often than
not, negation is “partial nega-tion” that
leads to another affirmation, that is in turn
limited by other negations, and so on: The fact
is that every signifi  cant predicate has a
limited range of ap- plication. Its correct use
is determined both by the fact that there is a  set
of occasions to which it applies and by the fact
that there is a set of occasions to which it does
not apply. This being so, it must always be
possible to fi  nd, or introduce, a predicate
which is complementary to  the predicate in
question, either, in the wide sense, as
applying to all and only those occasions to
which it does not apply, or, in a narrower sense,
as applying to all and only the occasions of this
sort that fall within a certain general range.
117 Thus, for every term X it is possible to
discover or introduce a term not- X. Such a term
can even be given an affirmative status while
remaining  functionally negative. For
example, if X = Shoggoths, instead of the neg-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    95
    </p></div><p>
    
 80 chapter two ative term “not-Shoggoth” we can
create a new term, spelling Shoggoth  backwards
for instance, giving us “Htoggohs.” The term
Htoggohs would be the negative complementary
to Shoggoth. Whereas the term “Shog-goth”
would mean “ancient, malevolent, oozing Elder
deity,” the term “Htoggohs” would have no
positive content, but would mean simply “not an
ancient, malevolent, oozing Elder deity”—a
defi  nition that leaves a lot  open. However,
Ayer goes on to make an important distinction.
If a negative  term is really a complementary
predicate to any affirmative term (which  is
itself defi  ned by the limits, or the negation,
of its usage), then there can  be more than one way
in which a negative term can operate. This Ayer
gives at the end of the citation above. There is,
fi  rst, a negation that ap- plies “to all and only
those occasions to which it does not apply.”
Ayer  refers to these kind of negative terms as
“not” terms (not- X, not-Shoggoth).  But there
is also a more nuanced, partial negation, one
that applies “to all  and only the occasions of
this sort.” Ayer refers to these as “non” terms
(non- X, non-Shoggoth). To say that something
is not- X is to say that it fun- damentally does
not apply, even though one might think it would
apply; it is something like a category error. By
contrast, to say that something is non-X is to
say that it does apply generally, but does not
apply specifi  cally.  For instance, to say that
something is a “not-black” is to say that black,
as a color, does not apply to the thing in
question, even though one is look-ing at what
appears to be a black painting on the wall. But it
is also true that a sound, an idea, or power
cannot be black—except insofar as black is used
metaphorically. By contrast, to say that
something is “non-black” is to still presume
that the thing in question can be colored, but
just not black (it can be quasi-black, like
charcoal grey, or another color altogether).
The distinction between “not” and “non” terms
can also be stratifi  ed. A  tiger can be a
“non-cat” if the general category of “pet” is
operative, or a tiger can be a “non-elephant” if
the general category of “mammal” is
op-erative, or a tiger can be “not-Shoggoth”
since it has nothing whatsoever to do with Elder
deities. Do Ayer’s distinction between “not”
and “non” terms apply to the on- tology of Life?
Earlier, we saw how both the Pseudo-Dionysius
and Eriu-gena develop a concept of superlative
Life via negation. For the Pseudo-Dionysius,
this was by way of the method of negative
theology, whereas for Eriugena this was by way
of the concept of nihil . In both cases, Life—
that by which the living is living—is in itself
not some thing. Thus, Life, as that which
affirms the living, can be thought only via
negation. In both cases, the affirmation of
negation itself pointed to a superlative limit
be-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    96
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 81 yond the affirmation of
negation itself. Both instances of
negation—of   apophasis—seem to be caught in the
conundrums pointed out by Frege. When we apply
the distinction between “not” and “non” terms
to the  ontology of Life, what is revealed is an
asymmetry. On the one hand, Life— as
superlative, as pure excess and
generosity—remains absolutely beyond the
living. If the living are conditioned by being
in time, then the superla-tive Life lies
outside the constraints of temporality, while
still allied with process, change, and dynamic
proliferation. Thus applying the concepts of
the living to Life does not apply, except in a
negative or superlative sense. We might say,
then, that Life is not-living . This is only part
of the story,  h o w e v e r .  F o r ,  e v e n  t h o u g h  L i f e  r e m
a i n s  a b s o l u t e l y  s u p e r l a t i v e ,  b e y o n d 
comparison, and a limit for thought, it is still
related to the  living—Life is  that by which the
living is living, and the living thus retains
some thread  of Life, be it in terms of creation,
emanation, or manifestation. Thus any given
instance of the living is non-Life . The
ontology of life, structured as  it is around the
Life-living dichotomy, contains within
itself the two sides  of negation—“not” from the
perspective of Life, “non” from the
perspec-tive of the living. 2.6.3 Negation vs.
Subtraction in Badiou Negation seems to
pervade the very possibility of affirmative
statements. Rather than presume that negative
terms are the opposite of affirmative terms,
negation—as limit—inheres in the very
possibility of affirmative terms and the
contingency of their usage. How do we account
for this pro-ductive, generative aspect of
negation? One possibility is not just to
con-sider an internal distinction (between
“not” and “non”), but to consider an external
distinction, between negation and other
similar terms. This is what Alain Badiou offers
in his distinction of the terms negation,
destruc-tion, and subtraction. For Badiou,
negation has both a negative and affir-mative
side, a “negative negation” and an
“affirmative negation.” What Ba-diou calls
“destruction” is the negative part of
negation, the passing-away of the old, the
“evental concentration which realizes the
negative power of negation.” 118 But negation
also has an affirmative side, one linked to cre-
ation: “the very essence of a novelty implies
negation, but must affirm its identity apart
from the negativity of negation.” 119 This is
what Badiou calls  “subtraction,” the
affirmative part of negation. One of the
examples Badiou uses is musicological (the
other is politi- cal): in the early twentieth
century, the innovation of Second Viennese

 82 chapter two both a destruction of and
subtraction from traditional Western classi-
cal music. This new music was, on the one hand, a
destruction of the old forms, the old ways of
composing, a destruction in the sense that it
posed a challenge to the traditional
system—one could no longer compose mu-sic
without in some way confronting this
challenge. But the music of the Second Viennese
School also achieved a subtraction from the
very tradi-tion it was acting against, having
developed a new method and a new way of
understanding music: “The point that we must
understand is that this new coherence is not new
because it achieves the process of
disintegra-tion of the system. The new
coherence is new to the extent that, in the
framework that Schönberg’s axioms impose, the
musical discourse avoids the laws of tonality,
or, more precisely, becomes indifferent to
these laws. That is why we can say that the
musical discourse is subtracted from its tonal
legislation.” 120 Subtraction, then, is
indelibly tied to a certain form of creation, a
form  of the production of novelty, one that
proceeds not by assertions or imposi- tions of
something, but one that articulates novelty by
way of receding, pulling back, withdrawing,
maneuvering. “Sub-traction, that which draws
under, is too often mixed with ex-traction,
that which draws from out of, that which mines
and yields the coal of knowledge.” 121 If
subtraction is not  a simple affirmation, if it
is not simply the production or agglomeration
of knowledge, then how does it obtain its
contradictory affirmative-negative
effects? B a d i o u  o f f e r s  f o u r  “ o p e r a t i o n s ”  b y  w h

These are the undecidable, the indiscernible,
the generic, and the  unnameable. We can briefl  y
describe them, using the distinction between 
life and death as examples. In a situation in
which the evaluation of state-ments a 1 or a2 is
based on some normative criteria (e.g., of
being alive or  dead, etc., that is, of x or y for a
statement F), “the undecidable statement  will
be the one that subtracts itself from that
norm.”122 So the undecidable  is some statement
an that is cumulatively not- F; it is
inapplicable to norms  that are defi  ned as being
exhaustive. Something similar happens with
the  indiscernible. If our statement F (x, y) has
the normative criteria of x = liv- ing and y =
dead, then the indiscernible is the inability
to distinguish, in  a statement F , the
difference between F (a1, a2) and F (a2, a1).
“The indiscern- ible is what subtracts itself
from the marking of difference as effected by
evaluating the effects of a permutation.” 123
In the case of the generic, the  issue has to do
with sets and totalization. If we consider a set
U—let’s say  it’s actually a species of living
organism—then each member of U can be 
hypothetically listed as a1, a2, . . . , an. We can
then take a statement F (x), 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    98
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 83 which takes the form “ x is
more complex than a1.” If we then take F (a2),  we
can arrive at a true or false statement
(depending on whether the or- ganism a2 is
organizationally more complex than a1). W e can
also create  a subset U1 that contains all those
instances of F(x) within the larger set  U. But
what if the statement F (x) actually changes
with each instance of  F(a2), F(a3), . . . , F(an)
because F (x) does totally account for each
instance  of a2, a3, . . . , an? What we would have is
another type of subset, a generic  subset that is
“subtracted from every identifi  cation,” a
subset that “con- tains a little bit of
everything, so that no predicate ever collects
together  all its terms.”124 Thus, “the generic
subset is subtracted from predication  by
excess.”125 Finally, there is the unnameable.
If we take again our state- ment F(x), here its
function can be a nominating one, so that, if x is
“the  last living human being,” it names
something that gives x a value (as true  or false)
if it is the only thing that gives a truth-value
to x . The unname- able is, by contrast, “the only
one in the universe that is not named by the
expression.” 126 It has the singularity of the
proper name, but its singularity  lies in its
being subtracted from any possibility of
naming Badiou neatly summarizes the
operations of subtraction as follows: the 
undecidable is subtracted from a norm  of
evaluation, the indiscernible is  subtracted
from the marking of difference , the generic is
subtracted from  the identity  of the concept,
and the unnameable is subtracted from the 
proper name . There is always an antagonism in
the creativity and produc- tivity of
subtraction. This antagonism is not simply
that of being opposi-tional or “anti-“ and
neither is it the reactionary mode of either
apathy or ressentiment . In its
“drawing-under,” it creates a kind of
house-of-cards  effect, in which each moment of
destruction turns on a moment of sub-traction,
and vice versa. In fact, it is in the isolation of
subtraction and destruction that Badiou sees
the stakes of contemporary politics: “That the
very essence of negation is destruction has
been the fundamental idea of the last century.
The fundamental idea of the beginning century
must be that the very essence of negation is
subtraction.” 127 Let us think about these four
operators of subtraction in relation to  the
distinction between life and death. In our
examples, the undecidable is that situation in
which the living/dead distinction does not
apply (we might call this the crystalline, or
even the “elemental”). The indiscern-ible is
that situation in which the living cannot be
distinguished from the dead, and vice versa (we
might call this “nonorganic life,” or even
“living dead”). The generic is that situation
in which the living can be articulated as a set,
but can never be totally accounted for as such
(we might call this “germinal life,” or even
“pathological life”). Finally, the
unnameable is 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    99
    </p></div><p>
    
 84 chapter two that situation in which the
singularity of life or death is such that it is
de- conceptualized, and is contracted into a
name (but a name beyond “Robert Neville” or “the
last man,” something like “those we do not speak
of”). These are all instances within
subtraction—but subtraction is more  broadly
coupled with destruction, the two forming the
process of nega-tion as Badiou theorizes it.
This notion of subtraction also pertains to the
relation between Life and the living. On one
level, the particular, singular instances of
the living always threaten the coherence of the
larger, more abstract categories of
biological species. There are always
exceptions to the rule, marginal cases,
unresolved puzzles, oddities, curiosities,
and undis-covered creatures. By defi  nition,
the monster is that which upsets catego- ries
and boundaries, it destroys the coherence of
the preexisting sets, in  fact challenging them
in their nonapplicability. In this sense, the
living is the destruction of Life . But Life, as
an ontological principle, as
that-by-which-the-living-is-  living, is not
simply a part-whole affair. If it is an
ontological principle,  “Life” will obtain its
effect not by enumerating all the instances of
it in the living, but by asserting a conceptual
necessity—as that without which the living is
inconceivable. As we’ve seen, the logic of this
relation is that of negative theology—Life
that conditions the living but which in itself
is “nothing.” Thus Life is what subtracts
itself from the living . There is one  instance in
which this subtraction ceases, and what ends up
being affirmed is the absent center (this is,
perhaps, what we see in Plotinus’ meditation on
Life and Time). But there is also another
instance in which the subtrac-tion of Life from
the living opens onto all sorts of cross-
pollinations (e.g.,  demonic life in the
Pseudo-Dionysius, the shadowy life in
Eriugena), and whose logical endpoint is the
dissolving of the concept of life altogether.
2.6.4 Negation and Contradiction in Priest In
this consideration of Life as it is related to
negation (Ayer) and subtrac-tion (Badiou), we
have forgotten one important thing, which is
that these processes of negation and
subtraction often turn on a fundamental
logi-cal contradiction. Life is both a
something and a nothing, both continu-ous with
the living and absolutely separate from it. The
ontology of Life thus bears within itself an
intimate relation to contradiction. This
would seem to undermine the concept itself,
since every thought of Life entails some
contradictory dynamic (something-nothing,
presence-absence, and so on). Despite this,
the concept of Life and its relation to the
living still functions in a wide array of fi  elds
and approaches, from the life sciences, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    100
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 85 to bioethics, to medical
and patent law, to biodefense applications, to
the  discourses surrounding climate change and
the environment. How then, should one regard
the concept of Life, insofar as it is
ontologized not only via negation (“not” vs.
“non”), and not only via subtraction, but also
by contradiction itself? Part of the dilemma is
that our thinking about contradiction can it-
self be contradictory. This is evident early on
in the West, in the form of  transition states
(Heraclitus’ famous formulation—“We step and
do not step into the same rivers; we are and are
not”) 128 and instances of move- ment (Zeno’s
equally well-known paradox of the arrow that
never reaches its destination). Non-Western
philosophies often place contradiction at the
center of their thinking, as can be seen in the
Zen concept of “unthink-ing” in the work of Do
ˉgen. There are other, more everyday examples
as  well: a person entering a room is, at one
moment, both inside and outside the room. Legal
and political philosophy provides an
abundance of such examples (e.g., a person who
fi  ts the category of those for which something
is legal and those for which something is
illegal). Graham Priest has suggested that,
because of examples such as these,  we ought to
reconsider the role that contradiction plays
in logic. In the Western tradition, the
dominant attitude was fi  rst formulated in
Aristo- tle’s Metaphysica . 129 There
Aristotle proposed that any statement A must  be
either true or false, but not both—what we have
come to know as the law of non-contradiction
(LNC). To this Aristotle adds a corollary,
which states that, for any statement X, it is
necessary that at least one of X or ¬ X  be true, but
they cannot both be true (often called the law of
the excluded middle). For Priest, the common
arguments for the LNC rest on the as-sumption
that “some” equals “all”—that is, if a
statement is in some ways contradictory , or in
some instances contradictory , then it must be
in all ways and at all times contradictory.
This—an inference type known as
“explosion”—means that, for all X and Y , the
contradiction of X and ¬ X  entails everything
else, or Y. This need not always be the case,
however.  A contradiction in one domain need not
immediately entail all domains. When this is
the case, the logical relation of explosion
fails, although the logic of the contradiction
remains—in such a case one must then consider
the logic as “paraconsistent.” One can, then,
consider the existence of contradictions as
both logi- cally coherent and as actually
existent: “The view that the LNC fails, that
some contradictions are true, is called
dialetheism . As we have already  seen, one does
not have to be a dialetheist to subscribe to the
correctness of a paraconsistent logic, though
if one is, one will.” 130 For Priest the com-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    101
    </p></div><p>
    
 86 chapter two mon arguments against
dialetheism, and in support of the LNC, all pre-
sume the absolute entailment of explosion: the
argument that contradic-tions have no meaning
or no content (when they have all content, total
content); the argument that if contradictions
are true, then nothing is true (when
contradictions exclude nothing); the
argument that negation sup-plies the truth
conditions for statements, so that ¬ X can be
true only if X  is not true (when, as we’ve seen,
negation is more than simply negative);  and the
argument from example, that contradictions
are not witnessed in the world (an inductive
argument based on selected examples). Does any
attempt to ontologize Life entail a dialetheic
approach? On  one level, the suggestion is
almost absurd—precisely because we
intui-tively accept it as true. “Life is
contradictory” says one person. “I don’t need a
philosopher to tell me that!” replies the
other: We, all of us, discover sometimes—maybe
by the prompting of some  Socratic
questioner—that our beliefs are
inconsistent. We assert a, and then a little
later assert ¬ a . . . We are not denying a. We do
accept a; that, after all, is the problem.
Hence, to assert a negation is not neces-sarily
to deny—and the problem that this objection
points to is just as much a problem for the
classical logician as for the dialetheist. 131
But beyond this, the way in which an ontology of
Life—that is, an attempt  to account for both the
very conditions or possibility of thinking
“life”—the way in which this ontology is
structured around negation is the key to
understanding Life as dialetheic. That
negation has many dimensions, from the
negation of a superlative Life in the
Pseudo-Dionysius to the nearly immanent
identifi  cation of Life with nihil  in Eriugena.
Hence, one  observation that dialetheism
provides on the ontology of Life is that
con-tradiction may be the very mechanism that
drives the ontological relation of Life and the
living. Does the ontological relation between
Life and the living function through a
dialetheic logic?  We might even say that, for
the  concept of superlative Life,
contradiction is fundamental and even
neces-sary, in order for the ontology of Life to
be thought at all. Thus, we have three modern
variants on the concept of negation, each  of
which offers three further distinctions on the
relation between negation and the concept of
Life: • Life is not-living, while the living is
non-Life (Ayer’s distinction  between “not”
and “non” terms).
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    102
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 87 • Life is subtracted from
the living, while the living is the destruc-
tion of Life (Badiou’s distinction between
negation, destruction, and subtraction). •
The ontology of the Life-living relation is
thinkable through a diale-theic logic
(Priest’s distinction between the LNC and
dialetheism). According to the apophatic
logic, Life—which conditions the very possi-
bility of the living—can never itself be one
among the living. Life must always remain
superlative, and thus negated from the living.
This means, in short, that Life can never be
inscribed within the set of all those things
that are called the living. But if Life is not
part of the set of the living, neither is it the
set of the living itself, for this would imply a
part-whole relationship that negative
theology explicitly avoids (and this is,
perhaps, where the Pseudo-Dionysius and
Eriugena part ways with Plotinus). These are,
for apophasis, the requirements for any
ontology of Life: that Life is not itself
contained with the set that it conditions, and
that Life is also not that set itself in its
totality. But neither does this mean that Life
is the meta-set, or the set of the set of the
living. The problem here is that what re-sults
is a logical mise-en-abîme . Thus, to the
proposition that “Life is not- a” is
immediately added “Life is not-not- a” and so
on. These can quickly  become logical games, to
be sure. But, in the context of the possibility
of an ontology of Life, what this apophatic
logic leads us to question is the very
tenability of the ontological relation
between Life and thought itself. Let us pause on
this point for a moment. As we said, the
apophatic  logic quickly becomes a
mise-en-abîme , negations “all the way down” in 
which negation becomes generative and
proliferative. We can entertain a number of
interpretations of what this might mean. On the
one hand, this seems to lead us into
contradiction, plain and simple. If it is
dialectic, it is one that is never resolved or
“raised up,” simply continually negated. But
because the process can hypothetically go on
forever, it actually means that the negativity
is, in some minimal sense, a generative one.
There are a number of ways of understanding this
generativity. In terms of modern logic, this
negation—that is, this superlative
negation—can simply be un-derstood as a kind of
machinic iteration, one which, by its purely
formal iteration, actually points to negation
that is both denumerable and infi  nite  (the
“not-not- a . . .” that goes on forever). Thus,
insofar as superlative Life  can only be thought
negatively, this negation-of-Life becomes a
kind of denumerable negation. In another vein,
the process of superlative negation in the
apophatic 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    103
    </p></div><p>
    
 88 chapter two logic can be understood as a
Deleuzian process, one in which what is re- p ea t
e d  ea c h  t im e  i s  dif f e r e n c e  i t s e lf .  E a c h  s u p e r l a
t i v e  n e g a t i o n  ( “ L if e  i s  not-not- a . . .”) is not
just a mechanical iteration, but it pushes
against the  limit of thought itself, each time
actually creating new conditions. This 
repetition of difference is not merely the
creation of new ideas or even new possibilities
or potentialities (that may or may not become
real), but it is, instead, a sort of phase shift
in the very conditions of thought itself
(“vir-tual while remaining fully actual” as
Deleuze often states). However, both of these
interpretations presume that something is 
added with each negation (“Life is not- a” . . .
“Life is not-not- a” . . . “Life is  not-not-not-
a” . . .). There is also the interpretation that
this iterative nega- tion is not additive but,
instead, simply neutral. It is the exact same
ges-ture each time, something like
Nietzsche’s eternal return, something like a
negative-ontological mantra. The horror of
this thought—a horror evoked in Nietzsche’s
parable—is precisely its neutralization, its
blankness, its expression of nihil . This seems
to be more the case with the Pseudo-  Dionysius,
as well as with the more “apophatic” moments in
Eriugena.  There is only one negation, only a
single “not- a” that can, despite its sin-
gularity, be infi  nitely repeated. There is,
then, no drama of affirmation or  negation,
superlative or privative, but rather a
pervasive neutralization. On e  qu es ti on  tha t 
th en  arises—a  qu es ti on  tha t  w e  will  return  to  in  
later sections—is whether this nihil - a s - n e u
tr aliz a ti o n  i s  s im p l y  an o th e r   name for
immanence, but a notion of immanence that is
effectively “empty.” For the time being, what
we can note is the way in which negation and  nihil 
come to play fundamental roles in the
articulation of a concept of  Life that is based
on its superlative, excessive generosity.
While instances of the living can be directly
understood and comprehended, Life can only be
negatively posited—exactly as that which is
not-living. Life is beyond any given instance
of the living, but it is also inseparable from
the living . 2.7 THE DIALETHEIC VITALISM OF
NEGATIVE THEOLOGY By way of conclusion, we can
step back and offer several propositions
con-cerning the concept of Life in terms of
time, temporality, and its super-lativity.
This can also serve as a way of talking about
method, since our inquiries will take up
Medieval and Scholastic thinking in a way that
is at once modern and nonmodern. Ultimately,
this is also the critical limit of any ontology
of life, when life is understood in terms of its
superlativity. Our fi  rst proposition is that,
for Medieval and Scholastic philosophy, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    104
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 89 God is ontologized in terms
of Being. This is our modern “misreading” of  the
Scholastics: every time we read “God” we should
really think “Being.” Put differently: what
Scholastic onto-theology means by God is what
mod-ern ontology means by Being. This is a
tactical approach to reading. It is not, of
course, to suggest that all theology reduces to
philosophy. But it is to suggest that we can
understand attempts to think the divine nature
in terms of what Kant described as the ens entium
, or the being of all beings.  Furthermore, this
is not exclusive to Scholasticism, but can be
discerned in classical thought (e.g., Plato’s
demiurge in the Timeaus ) and in the Neo-
platonic synthesis (e.g., Plotinus and the
Primordial Causes). A second proposition
extends from the fi  rst: Being is regarded as in-
dissociable from beings via the process of
emanation. What modern   ontologies—most
notably, that of Heidegger—articulate as the
ontological  difference between Being and
beings is established in two phases: fi  rst,  a
classical phase, in which that-which-exists
is distinguished from
that-by-which-something-exists, either by
model, mold, and perfection (Plato), by cause,
form, and creation (Aristotle), or by a
perfection that is also the cause (Plotinus).
With Plotinus, the conceptual hierarchy is
maintained, while also allowing for the
necessary relation between divine and
earthly, supernature and nature. Medieval and
Scholastic thought can be regarded as
different ways of formalizing the problems
that arise from this basic distinction: the
divine as at once static and dynamic, the
relation between Creator and creature, and the
transcendence and/or immanence of the di-vine
in nature. A third proposition, again
extending from the second: Emanation or 
emanative Being is most often granted a
superlative status as “Life.” From a metonymic
shift of God-as-Being, to the distinction
between Being and beings, comes the necessity
of mediation between the Being and beings,
Creator and creature, Life and the living.
Something that conditions ev-erything is at
the same time “in” everything. The Neoplatonic
notion of an emanative, radiating source must
also be thought in temporal terms. But, if it is
not to be confused with the temporality of
nature and the liv-ing, its temporality must be
thought of in a superlative, absolute sense.
Thus, working from analogy, what the domain of
the living is to the tem-porality of nature, the
superlative Life of the divine is to the
temporality of emanation and creation. But
there is a problem, for the analogy only begs the
question of how  this life-beyond-life is
different from the creaturely domain of the
living. Hence, a fourth proposition: The
superlative Life of emanative Being is
characterized in terms of its generosity.
Superlative Life, if it is not to be 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    105
    </p></div><p>
    
 90 chapter two constrained by temporality,
must also be thought of as pure excess, as gen-
erosity, and an endless fl  owing-forth. This
problem is raised by Plotinus,  but its true
articulation comes in the Pseudo-Dionysius
and is later nu- anced by Eriugena. That which is
pure generosity, pure superlative Life, that
which never “runs out,” cannot simply be
thought positively, as an infi nite reservoir
or anthropomorphized Goodness, but it must
instead be  thought negatively, as that which is
nothing ( nihil ) precisely because it is 
superlative. This gesture towards negation
leads us to a fi  nal proposition: Life as 
generosity is negatively articulated in terms
of the “divine inaccessible.” If superlative
Life can be thought only negatively, then this
means that the only relation between Life and
the living is a non-relation, or a relation of,
literally, nothing. How can Life be nothing?
There are really two key ques-tions here:
First, is Life itself living? On the one hand,
Life is not living, because it is not one among
the living; on the other hand, Life in its
ontol-ogization is itself the
principle-of-life, coextensive with each and
every in-stance of the living. This leads to a
second, more basic question: Does Life exist?
On the one hand, Life in itself is no thing, and
does not exist; on the other hand, the concept of
Life as superlative not only presumes
exis-tence, but it also conditions the
ontological modes of what Aristotle called 
“coming-to-be” and “passing-away.” In both
cases—the relation between  Life and the
living, and the relation between Life and
Being—a condition of contradiction appears to
be fundamental to the very thought of Life. The
impasse here has to do with whether or not any
attempt to resolve the contradiction
sublimates Life into something else: Life as
indistinguish-able from divine, sovereign
Creation (theology); Life as subordinate to
Be-ing (metaphysics); or Life as pure
description and classifi  cation (biology).  In
each instance, Life dissipates into God,
Being, or the living. Earlier we outlined the
logic specifi  c to the concept of superlative
life,  an apophatic logic. To this we can add the
above propositions. They out-line the
conceptual progression whereby the concept of
Life as an ontology surfaces and recedes before
thought: from God to Being (fi  rst
proposition),  from beings emanated from Being
(second proposition), from emanation to the
temporality of life (third proposition), from
life to generosity (fourth proposition), and
from generosity to the divine inaccessible (fi 
fth proposi- tion). In this process the
tenuousness of the concept of Life is revealed,
as it surfaces from a discourse that
ontologizes the divine nature, and then is
submerged beneath contradictions that are
resolved in terms of theology or biology. Our
goal here is not to dispense with the general
concept of life, but 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    106
    </p></div><p>
    
  superlative life 91 neither is it to defend or
conserve it. Rather, in our mode of critique,
our  goal was to begin to delineate the contours
of a concept that appears to mean so many things
that it means nothing, a concept that is
everywhere formally operative and yet emptied
of content. In this section we’ve out-lined one
of the dominant attributes of life when
ontologized in terms of time, temporality, and
process. As our considerations of Plotinus,
the Pseudo- Dionysius, and Eriugena have
suggested, this notion of life-as-time  is not
an exclusively modern thought. Rather, it is
formulated in a range of premodern discourses,
from mystical theology to Medieval natural
phi-losophy. In particular, it is formulated
in an inadvertently subversive way, where
Life, as superlative, is indelibly linked to
negation, darkness, and nihil . Thus, a central
lesson that we can draw from the negative
ontolo- gies of the Pseudo-Dionysius and
Eriugena: Superlative Life is defi  ned as  the
necessary inaccessibility of Life to the
living. To this, we can append a  note on method:
the ground and the limit of any ontology of Life
is nega-tive ontology. 2.8 ELLIPSES:
SUHRAWARDI ˉ AND THE LUMINOUS VOID The
Aristotelian distinction between Life and the
living addresses the prob l em of on to l ogy in
rela ti on to “ life, ” in tha t i t provi des both a
uni -versal conceptual ground as well as a way of
accounting for its manifes-tations. But this
distinction only highlights the problem of the
relation between Life and the living. The
question is whether Life is, in relation to the
living, an essence concept. On the one hand,
Life can only be nega-tively thought in
relation to the living, and yet this concept
grounds the very intelligibility of the living
as such (and, by extension, the “realism” of
Life itself). This leads to a dilemma, which is
how to maintain the ne-cessity of the
Life-living distinction while also allowing
for the blurring between the terms, often to the
point that they negate each other. The
tradition of negative theology offers one
example of an attempt to  resolve this dilemma.
While the question of life is never simply a
question of natural philosophy (or even of
natural theology), it is also not simply a
question of pure theology. This paradoxical
life-beyond-life, what Aquinas obliquely
calls “the Life of God,” serves as the platform
on which philoso-phy grapples with a concept of
Life that is neither that of Aristotelian
Be-ing nor that of the Patristic God. The
contradiction at the heart of negative
theology relies on a back- and-forth between
affirmation and negation: the superlative can

 92 chapter two ten characterized by a
dichotomous split between the rhetorical fi 
gures of  light and darkness. In this way, the
Pseudo-Dionysius shares a great deal  with the
darkness mysticism of St. John of the Cross or
The Cloud of Un- knowing . But the dichotomy is
less theological than it is ontological—in  the
interplay of light and darkness, like that of
affirmation and negation, one serves to
continually supersede the other . In fact,
negative theology  requires this dichotomy,
because it structures the inversion that is so
cen- tral to its philosophical style:
affirmation always leads to negation, and
af-fi rmative to negative theology. For these
thinkers, the highest affirmation  must always
be in excess of any particular affirmation
itself, and must therefore become, in
Eriugena’s words, the “dark intelligible
abyss.” Negative theology articulates one
facet of the ontology of life after Ar- istotle:
life defi  ned in terms of its temporality, its
generosity, its super- lative nature. But in so
doing, it is led to what appears to be the oppo-s i
t e :  lif e  a s  “ n o t hin g . ”  An d  m u c h  o f  t hi s  i s  p r e di c
a t e d  o n  t h e  in t e rp l a y  of light and darkness, as
analogues of the logic of affirmation and
nega-tion. Here let us pose a question: would it
be possible to preserve this no-tion of
life-as- nothing, while at the same time
bypassing the dichotomous  thinking of
light-darkness? That is, is it possible to
refuse the dichotomy of light- darkness while
not attempting to resolve the contradiction of 
life-as-nothing? Let us consider something
other than light or darkness—perhaps 
something like glowing, or duskiness, or
luminescence. Medieval Ara-bic philosophy
provides us with a number of examples. One is the
tradi-tion of “illuminationist” ( ishraˉq)  m y
s t i c i s m ,  a s s o c i a t e d  w i t h  t h i n k e r s   such as
Shiha ˉb al-Din al-Suhrawardı ˉ. Like the
tradition of negative theol- ogy, Suhrawardı
ˉ’s works display both the infl  uence of
Aristotelianism—   fi ltered through thinkers
such as Avicenna—as well as a marked infl  uence 
of Platonic and Neoplatonic thinking (not to
mention the array of Greek Gnostic, Hermetic,
and Persian Zoroastrian elements that are also
part of Suhrawardı ˉ’s works). Though he made
contributions in metaphysics,  cosmology,
mystical poetry, and logic, Suhrawardı ˉ—who
was accused of  h eresy concerning his vi ews on th
e access to m ystical know l edge—also developed
a complex ontology of illumination. This is
presented in texts such as the
late-twelfth-century Philosophy of
Illumination , though, as  scholars such as
Henry Corbin have suggested, it is a motif
already present in early works such as Temples
of Light . Suhrawardı ˉ’s primary interest lies
in a conception of the divine, and  the world as
divine, in terms of light—everything is
understood in terms of luminosity and
illumination, lightening and darkening,
dependent and

  superlative life 93 autonomous lights (“light
in its own reality”), “accidental” lights
(“light  that is a state of something else”), and
the “Light of Lights.” In one sense, Suhrawardı
ˉ’s ontology of light follows a broadly
Neoplatonic pattern, in  which a divine source
radiates outward into the world. But this
ontology  of light must also take account of
darkness. Although the Philosophy of 
Illumination ’s primary concern is light, it is
often darkness, darkening,  and luminosity
that prove more difficult to conceptualize.
These are, on the one hand, simply a lessened
instance of pure or non-accidental light:
“Darkness is simply an expression for the lack
of light, nothing more.” 132  This absolute
differentiation means that light can no more
cause darkness than something can be created
out of nothing. Here Suhrawardı ˉ distin-
guishes between light in its effected or
accidental state, and Light as a causal
radiating source. But then where does darkness
come from, or can one even say that  it is produced
at all—or that it “ is” at all? Suhrawardı ˉ
appears to divide  darkness into an incorporeal
and corporeal instantiation (the “dusky
sub-stance” and “dusky body,” respectively).
If the latter are understood to be concrete,
physical entities, then the former are
“barriers,” through which light is cut off. At
the same time that the Light of all Lights is
carried above and beyond darkness, the
question of the light of darkness persists:
“Thus, that which gives all dusky substances
their lights must be some-thing other than
their gloomy quiddities and dark states.” 133
While the dark  light or the dark body may not
directly partake of the Light of Lights, its
very existence presumes a minimal
luminosity—“that which gives them their
lights must be something other than the
barriers and dusky sub-stances.” 134 This
effectively leads Suhrawardı ˉ to
conceptualize a light—or  better, a
superlative radiation—that is neither the
Light of Lights, nor the mere privation of all
light. “You will learn that dark states are
caused by light, even though the light itself
may also be accidental.” 135 Ultimately,
Suhrawardı ˉ’s ontology of light opens onto an
affirmation  of the divine as superlative. But,
considering how the concept of superla-tive
life always turns on its negation, we might
speculate about the role of darkness in
Suhrawardı ˉ and its relation to Eriugena’s
concept of nihil . The  “dusky” or the luminous
is, for Suhrawardı ˉ, neither pure light nor
dark- ness, but the continuum or the spectrum of
lighting or darkening; it is luminescence,
iridescence, and glow. 136 Illumination is
Suhrawardı ˉ’s fi rst  principle, but it is both
immaterial and unfi  xed; it is not quite the
Aristote- lian distinction of form and matter,
but neither is it quite the Neoplatonic
stratifi  cation of divine source and its strict
hierarchies. This emphasis on a  spectrum as a fi 
rst principle implies that every assertion of
transcendence 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    109
    </p></div><p>
    
 94 chapter two must also assert, equally , an
assertion of immanence. When Suhrawardı ˉ 
notes that all illumination exists by virtue of
a Light of Lights, this must  be countered by the
continuum of this Light of Lights in all
entities that it constitutes. If we were to take
a strong reading of Suhrawardı ˉ, we would  say
that every assertion of a fi  rst principle, a
Light of Lights, must also be  an assertion of the
diffusion that is light itself. The insight of
luminosity and duskiness in Suhrawardı ˉ’s
works is that  it is a variant on the idea of
participation: everything participates in 
and  of illumination. Illumination is, on the
one hand, the animating princi- ple of each
individuated being—it is at once ousia  and
psukhe ˉ—and it is,  on the other hand, that which
conditions the interrelation of all things. 
Suhrawardı ˉ’s ontology of illumination
therefore takes light as both a  source and
diffusion, as both origin and continuum. For
Suhrawardı ˉ, a key  generative characteristic
of light is that of intensity; intensity of
illumina-tion determines the ontological
status of any being. This is less a
Neopla-tonic, aggregative notion, in which
the further away one is from a source, the less
reality one has. Instead, there can be degrees
of intensity at all lev-els. This is never
directly stated by Suhrawardı ˉ; it remains an
unexplored notion, and tends to glossed over by
an assertion of a hierarchical para-digm of
illumination (the Light of Lights emanates a
Second Light, a Third Light, and so on). But its
implication is that light is always
illumination, and illumination is always
intensity or a fl  uctuation, and intensity
brings  one more into the domain of luminosity,
the dusky, and the glowing; il-l u m i n a t i o n  i s  m o
r e  l i k e  l u m i n e s c e n c e  o r  fl  ickering. If this is
the case,  then the Aristotelian framework of
Life and the living, as the
Dionysian-Eriugenan framework of
superlative life—this would then become
dis-solved into a sort of pulsing fi  eld of
glowing substances, dark accidents,  fl
ickering formal causes, and a luminous void
that functions as the ani- mating principle of
the world. Suhrawardı ˉ’s ontology of
luminosity does something as powerful as it  is
simple: by structuring an ontology around the
spectrum of light and darkness, Suhrawardı ˉ
renders irrelevant the Aristotelian
distinction be- tween substance and accident.
This has implications for the distinction
between Life and the living. While Life is
distinct from the living, it is also, for
Aristotle, inseparable from it; Life is not
another instance of the living, and there is no
Life in itself. But whereas Aristotelianism
can only assert the non-distinction between
Life and the living by fi  rst positing that 
distinction, Suhrawardı ˉ’s illuminationism
asserts a continuum between  Life and the living
by asserting the ontological priority of that
continuum over the Life-living distinction.

illumination without a source, diffusion 
without a cause, radiation without a center—be
that an absent or a negated center. If an
ontology of life demands, as one of its aspects,
a way of think-ing of life in terms of its
generosity, its generativity, and its
superlative na-ture, then the
illuminationist question is whether this
superlative nature can be thought of as
something like a “luminous void.” 137

 96For this whole world is called new because it
is not eternal and there- fore is
nothing.—Eriugena 3.1 ON SPIRITUAL CREATURES
In the fi  rst part of this book, we considered the
concept of life defi  ned  in terms of time and
temporality. There we found that the ontology
of  “life” relied upon a notion of Life that was in
pure excess of the living— both as its source and
as its ontological ground. Life was thus defi 
ned in  terms of its generosity, its fl 
owing-forth, and its being “superlative
life.”  But we also saw that, within this
framework, there was another anti-  tradition
in which Life was defi  ned not in terms of its
affirmation but in  terms of negation. Life is in
this case not that which is subservient to the 
divine, but that which describes the absolute
negation of the divine, its limit to all
thought, its not constituting a discrete
object of thought, but the limit of thought
itself. At this limit, we arrive at a notion of
Life that is superlative precisely because its
immanence implies that it is, literally,
nothing ( nihil ). T h i s  c o n t r a d i c t i o n — L i f e  t h a
t  i s  s u p e r l a t i v e  b e c a u s e  i t  i s  n o t h i n g — leads us
to ask how this concept of superlative life is,
in a way, bound to a concept of the living. If Life
is related to the living as an ontological
ground to that which it grounds, and if Life is
superlative in the sense that we’ve discussed,
then what does this say about the concept of the
living it-self? We have considered the
ontology of life as structured around a certain
pulling-apart between Life and the living.
Here we can approach things from a different
direction: how does the idea of superlative
life condition chapter three Univocal

    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    112
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 97 a certain
binding-together between the Life and the
living? That relation  has several dimensions
to it. It is, fi  rst, a relation between an
ontological  ground and that which it grounds;
Life as that concept which is necessary  in order
to think the living. But it is also a causal
relation, a relation in which a principle of
causality structures that which can possibly
exist. Life is not simply that which grounds the
possibility of thinking the liv-ing as the
living, but Life is also that which encompasses
the production of the living. Put simply, Life
is that which conditions the creation of the
living. Thus, when we speak of the relation
between Life and the living, we are also
speaking about a process of creation that defi 
nes this relation.  In Scholastic philosophy,
the terms Creator, creation, and creature
delin-eate the contours this discourse. The
term “creature” in English has several modern
connotations, one  of which is nearly
synonymous with “animal” or even “monster.”
Indeed, creatures seem to be positioned
somewhere between animals and mon-sters, the
normal and the pathological, the well-formed
and the de-formed. This connotation has become
part of our popular vernacular: in the early
twentieth century, for instance, Hollywood
studios produced “creature-feature” fi  lms
that featured the icons of genre
horror—Dracula, Franken- stein’s monster,
the Wolf Man, the Creature from the Black
Lagoon, and so  on. The creature is, in these
instances, not quite the animal, for the
ani-mal can be named, assigned a species, and
analyzed as a living organism. The creature is
animal-like, but also not quite an
animal—perhaps some-thing like
Schopenhauer’s “metaphysical animal.” It is
either less than an animal (e.g., the
plant-creatures of The Thing From Another
World ), some  hybrid of animal and human (e.g.,
the morphologies of The Wolf Man or  Cat People ),
or , in some cases, the creature that actually
transcends the  animal (e.g., the telepathic
“thought creatures” of Fiend Without a Face ).
Such examples are worth taking seriously, for
they suggest that the  creature, as that which is
not-quite-animal, is also that which is not-
quite-spiritual. The modern avatars of these
“spiritual creatures” demon-strate the ways
in which horror and theology are always
intimately con-nected with each other.
Similarly, in the Scholastic era, a central
concern is that of the ontological status of
intermediary beings between the earthly and
the divine, including angels, demons, and the
more anonymous “pri-mordial causes” of
Neoplatonism. Aquinas’ comments on the
subject summarize many of the main questions,
which, to modern eyes, appear fantastical,
almost absurd: Do intermediary beings like
angels have bod-ies, and if so, are they then
subject to the effects of growth and decay? If
intermediary beings do have bodies, are they
transcendent bodies, above

 98 chapter three and beyond the earthly bodies
of humans and animals? Insofar as interme-
diary beings do have bodies, is there a
distinction between angels and de-mons, with
the latter often defi  ned by their incarnations
in and as beasts?  Do angels get hungry, eat, and
defecate? The problematic of the creature is
more than a category problem, how- ever, for it
touches upon a central
philosophical-theological problem for 
Scholastic thinkers: once one posits the
absolute distinction between the divine and
the earthly, the supernatural and the natural,
Life and the liv-ing, then how does one account
for the relation between them, given that the
human is, doctrinally speaking, partially
divine? That is, if the human is
more-than-animal, then it is also
less-than-spiritual. Hence the problem of the
creatura  is also a problem of mediation. And
some form of media- tion is required to account
for the fuzzy ontological status of the living 
being, especially the living being that is the
human being. The concept of creation comes to
play this mediating role. Its func- tion is
outlined quite early by the Church Fathers.
Augustine, in a com- mentary on Psalm 73, states
the question—“How do I know that thou art alive,
whose soul I see not?”—and immediately
provides the answer—“By the operations of the
body I know thee to be living, canst thou not by
the works of creation know the Creator?” 1 This
is, generally speaking, the  logic of
theophany. The divine Life in itself is not
knowable except by its manifestations in the
earthly incarnations of the living. It is
formalized in  th e  man y  tr ea tis es  o n  th e  cr ea tur
e  in  S c h o las ti c is m  b y  A q uinas ,  Bo-naventure,
William of Auvergne, and others. From this
natural philosophy would derive the notion of
the Book of Nature, and, as Bonaventure would
note, the very status of the creature would be
understood as a trace ( ves- tigium ) or
“footprint” of the divine on earth. The triad of
Creator, creation, and creature has had a
decisive impact  on Western philosophical and
theological refl  ections on nature. Nested 
within them is a concept of Life and the living
whose relation is structured through
causality. But the central problematic is in
articulating what type of causality this is—in
particular, whether the creature is created
from-without or from-within. During the
highpoint of Scholasticism, this view was far
from being the only view on the topic; the
debates that ensued of-ten revolved around
whether or not one could think the creature in
terms that were more immanent than
transcendent, more auto-morphic than
hy-lomorphic, more a “univocal” creature than
a creature defi  ned in terms  of analogy and
representation. Before considering these
debates, however, we can spend a bit of time
reviewing the role of form and causality as it
pertains to the Life-living relationship.

  Univocal Creatures 99 3.2 LIFE AS FORM IN
ARISTOTLE When the concept of life is thought of
in terms of Creator, creation, and  creature,
life appears in a twofold guise: the
life-that-is-formed and the
life-that-forms. In the former sense, life is
that which is formed in the var-ious forms of
life that can give us the stratifi  cations of
plant, animal, and  human life. 2 In a more
important sense, life is the very principle by
which  such forms of life take form. Here life is
neither the individuated living be-ing, nor
even the larger categories (such as species)
within which such be-ings are situated. Life in
this second sense is more like the
life-that-forms, the life which itself
produces the various life-forms. What is
apparent, then, is that the issue of causality
is at the center  of the relation between Life and
the living; every life-form necessitates some
principle by which this particular life is
formed. Note that while this principle itself
is necessitated, the question of whether this
princi-ple is internal or external to the
life-form is not determined. Even if the lif e - f
o rm  is  r e gar d ed  as  ha ving  i ts  ca usali ty  in t e
rnal  t o  i ts e lf —an d  th us  self-causing—the
necessity of a casual principle is still
preserved, though modifi  ed. In short, the
life-form necessitates the forming of life,
and thus  a mode of causality specifi  c to life.
Aristotle refers to this necessary cause  as
psukhe ¯, or the life-principle. The
life-principle is simply that by which  life is
formed, a life-forming principle, or, to refer
to our earlier, more cumbersome phrase: as a
principle of causality, psukhe ¯ is
that-by-which- the-living-is-living. This
distinction between life-forms and the
life-that-forms, between the living and Life,
is crucial for the way the concept of life itself
is formed in the ontology of Aristotle. And, it
is Aristotle who, perhaps more than any
classical thinker, provides us with a
systematic way of thinking about life in terms
of form, causality, and a life-principle. The
De Anima  is dedicated to explicating the
concept of psukhe ¯ as it  is manifested in
various types of life, which Aristotle
generally divides up in an ascending order of
complexity: a nutritive psukhe ¯ (plants), a
sensate  and motile psukhe ¯ (animals), and a
rational psukhe ¯ (humans). This strati- fi
cation is not only hierarchical for Aristotle,
but cumulative as well—the  nutritive is
contained within the sensate-motile, while
both of these are contained in the rational. The
De Anima  thus conceptualizes a life that  is at
once abstract and real, a life-forming
principle that is at once insepa-rable from the
types of life-forms in which it is manifest,
while not being reducible to them. But here we
must note that the concept of life appears to be
threefold,  for while psukhe ¯ is not the actual
animal, it is still internally divided be-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    115
    </p></div><p>
    
 100 chapter three tween psukhe ¯ as the
life-principle in itself, and psukhe ¯ as
manifested in  different forms (plant, animal,
and human types of psukhe ¯). It appears that 
there are different types of psukhe ¯ that
correspond to different types of  life-forms,
and yet Aristotle goes to great measures to
ensure the coher- ence of a single psukhe ¯ in
general that unites all of these. Thus we have 
three aspects to this relation between life and
form: psukhe ¯ as a principle,  psukhe ¯ as types,
and the actual living creature. Another
conclusion to be drawn from Aristotle is that
the fi  rst psukhe ¯,  psukhe ¯ as the life-forming
principle, this psukhe ¯ in itself does not,
strictly  speaking, exist. The life-principle
or psukhe ¯ has being only to the extent  that it is
qualifi  ed by bearing some formal relation to
the essence of what  it is to be a plant, animal, or
human. Even then, the question of whether s u c h 
uni v ersals  as  “ p lan t ”  o r  “ animal ”  r eall y  e xis t 
cann o t  be  tak en  f o r  granted. All we are left
with, then, is the direct observation of
individ-ual entities (which we may
subsequently name plants, animals, humans, or
the Old Ones). What Aristotle conceptualizes
as the very essence of life, psukhe ¯, is itself
unavailable to any sensory or empirical verifi 
cation.  This is, furthermore, a necessary part
of the concept of psukhe ¯. If it were  something
in itself like an object, or something
available to our senses like light, then it
would cease to be a life-principle or
life-that-forms, and would become a
life-form, and the problem of thinking life in
itself would thus remain. Again, the
conceptual requirement that Aristotle has set
himself is that one move from that the living is
living to how the living is  living. On a
philosophical level, any such requirement
makes a contradic-tory demand: that one think
the living by thinking beyond the living. What,
then, enables Aristotle to claim that there is
something such as  a life-principle or psukhe ¯
at all? Aristotle must make a wager (and the De 
Anima  can, in a sense, be read as an extended
conceptual w ager on the  question of life
itself). This wager is the following: that
there is a concept of life in which life is not
reducible to the living. On the surface this may
seem quite ordinary, but it has several
components to it: fi  rst, it posits the  key
ontological distinction between Life and the
living. The conceptual requirements of
causality necessitate this distinction, and
its necessity remains, as we’ve noted, even if
the idea of self-causality is entertained. In
addition, Aristotle makes the wager that this
notion of life can be ade-quately thought—in
other words, that life is available to thought,
that life is intelligible “for us.” That life
can be thought is no small claim. It means that
the concept of life is a concept that is specifi  c
to philosophy and not,  for instance, mysticism
or science. The implicit wager in the De Anima   is
that there is a logic to life such that the
thought of life would become 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    116
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 101 commensurate with life
itself, all the while refusing mysticism or
science.  This is the real challenge of any
ontology of life, and Aristotle is arguably the
fi  rst to formulate it: how to think a concept of
life that is, on the one  hand, irreducible to the
living, and, on the other hand, which does not
im- mediately evoke the mystical or is
compromised by the scientifi  c? It is not 
difficult to see how this challenge structures
much of the philosophical thinking that
follows: vitalism vs. mechanism, organicism
vs. material-ism, nature-as-poem vs.
nature-as-matheme. But such a wager raises the
problem of method—how should one  go about
thinking the concept of life, given that this
challenge is also about thought itself?
Aristotle’s solution is to adopt different
methods— philosophical exegesis in the De
Anima , and classifi  cation and description  in
works such as the Historia Animalium . Here the
distinction between  Life and the living
requires two separate methods, metaphysical
specu- lation for the life-that-forms and
empirical description for the life-forms.
Aristotle says relatively little about the
connection between them, though the domain of
animal life-forms predominates in both kinds
of works. 3 So while Aristotle adopts different
methods based on the distinction  between Life
and the living, or between the life-that-forms
and the life-form, this separation of method
leaves open the question of the relation
between Life and the living, the
life-that-forms and life-forms. Hence one of
the central, enigmatic questions of
Aristotle’s ontology of life: Is the
life-principle itself living? Is the
life-that-forms also a life-form? On the one
hand this is precisely what Aristotelian
philosophy can- not affirm, for if the
life-principle is itself living, then this
would neces-sitate a further principle by
which the life-principle was living, and so on.
The question of the vitality of the
life-principle itself follows Aristotle’s
arguments for a fi  rst cause—one that is “fi  rst”
not merely sequentially,  but ontologically.
On the other hand the treatment of psukhe ¯ as the
life- forming principle is perplexing because
it seems to sidestep the traditional
Aristotelian metaphysical scenario. In the De
Anima  the life-principle  psukhe ¯ is variously
described as a primary substance, a
hylomorphic pro- cess (form as active, matter
as passive), as an essence particular to life,
and as the very boundary between the living and
nonliving. Let us suppose that the
life-principle psukhe ¯ is not itself living.
We would then have an  instance in which life
would be caused by non-life; life would be
caused by that which is its own negation, or
better, which bears no relation to it at all. But
the life-principle cannot not have any
relation to the living what-soever, for the
very act of causality implies some relation,
and therefore something fundamentally in
common. If we take the other position and 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    117
    </p></div><p>
    
 102 chapter three assume that the
life-principle psukhe ¯ is identical to the
living, we have no  way of distinguishing the
fact that something is alive from how it is
alive,  and have removed the need for a concept of
life at all. At this point one  would,
presumably, simply live, and not think at all . .
.  Psukhe ¯ is a strange, hybrid concept,
positioned between a physics of  life-forms
(the phusis  of plant, animal, human) and a
metaphysics of fi  rst  causes. Part of this
confusion derives from a distinction (between
Life and the living) that methodologically
becomes a division (between a life- essence and
particular animals). It is precisely this
problem that comes to  occupy a central place in
Scholastic thinking about the relation
between a life-principle and the various
instances of the living. But, as we will see, the
methods are different. Some, such as Aquinas,
prefer a more top-down approach, by which one
begins with the divine and descends to the
crea-turely. Others, such as Ockham, assert
that there can only be a bottom-up approach,
beginning from what we know for certain to
exist, which are discrete individuals. Still
others, such as Duns Scotus, employ both
ap-proaches, but in order to reach a
commonality between the life-that-forms and
the life-form. Whatever their methods,
Scholastic thought takes up the wager and the
challenge offered by Aristotle: the wager that
there is a distinction between Life and the
living, and the challenge of how to think a
concept of life that is neither reducible to the
living (let us say “biol-ogy”) nor identical to
mysticism and the ineffable (let us say
“theology”). In modern terms, the concept of
life as a philosophical concept becomes, in
Scholastic thought, poised between biology
and theology . . .  There are a few lessons that
Scholasticism draws from Aristotle. The  fi
rst, recall, is that Aristotle’s concept of
psukhe ¯ o r  th e  lif e - p rin c i p l e  i s   itself
bifurcated between psukhe ¯-in-itself and
psukhe ¯-as-types, and both  of these are
further distinguished from the actual
instances of living crea-tures described in
Aristotle’s natural philosophy. We therefore
have some-thing called “life” that, while
retaining its unity, is also existent in at
least three forms: in itself, in various types,
and in individuals. Another lesson is that of
these instances of life each does not exist in 
the same way. For example, as an entity in
itself, psukhe ¯ is never present  as such, but
only in the various types or in individuals.
Furthermore, if psukhe ¯ is present in the
various types, this would require a theory of
uni- versals to account for the types of plant,
animal, and human as really, and not ideally,
existing. This leaves us with the discrete
individuals, and the question of whether such
individuals, as really existing, can be
thought without recourse to either psukhe
¯-in-itself or psukhe ¯-as-types—the for-

  Univocal Creatures 103 mer of which does not
exist, and the latter of which presumes
universal  existence. The innovation of
Scholastic thinking on this issue is to have
brought  these two lessons from Aristotle
together into a single challenge: how to  think
life as a relation between the life-that-forms
and life-forms , or, using  our own terms, as a
relation between Life and the living. Both the
Aristo- telian, tripartite aspect of psukhe ¯
(as in itself, as types, and as individuals),  as
well as the idea that psukhe ¯ in itself cannot be
thought except via its   manifestation—both of
these notions dovetail into what will become
the  central concern of Scholastic thinking:
the relation between Creator and creature,
divine and earthly, the life-that-forms and
its attendant life-forms. This is one way of
understanding the emergence of the concept of
the creature (creatura ) in Scholastic
philosophy—that it serves as a condensation
point  for thinking about the relation between
the life-that-forms and life-forms. For
Scholasticism, this challenge also involves a
new problem—if being  for Scholastic thinkers
is the proper provenance of philosophy, and if
the divine is the proper provenance of
theology, then this third question—that of
life—opens onto a set of discourses that sit
somewhere between them: natural theology,
natural philosophy, theodicy, theophany.
Simplifying a great deal, we can suggest that
one of the central problems of Scholasti-cism
is that Life as a concept is not necessarily
different from the problem of God or
Being—though it is not identical to them
either. In context, such problems did not arise
without a great deal of debate  and controversy.
They seem rather trivial and “scholastic” by
contempo-rary standards, but in
thirteenth-century Paris or Oxford they could
carry the weight of condemnation or heresy. The
translation of Aristotle’s works in natural
philosophy in the thirteenth century opened up
new ways of thinking, but they were also
situated at the center of a series of
philo-sophical, theological, and political
controversies. Endless debates ensued over
whether Aristotle proposed the eternity of the
universe as opposed to divine creation, or
whether Aristotle’s De Anima  really did deny
per- sonal immortality in his notion of the
“Active Intellect.” At its pinnacle such
debates resulted in a series of censures by the
Church. The most fa-mous of these occurred in
1277 , issued by Bishop Étienne T empier, at the
request of the pope. These condemnations of
some two hundred specifi  c  articles forbade the
Faculty of Arts at the University of Paris from
teach-ing certain portions of Aristotle’s
works (principally the works in natural
philosophy), as well as the teachings of
Aristotle’s Arabic commentators such as
Averroës, and contemporary Christian
thinkers working in the

 104 chapter three Aristotelian tradition
(including, at fi  rst, parts of Aquinas’
teachings, as  well as radical Latin Averroists
such as Siger of Brabant). Prominent think- ers
at the University of Paris, such as Henry of
Ghent, served on the com-mittee that drafted up
the condemnations—and it was, in part,
precisely against the position of Henry that
later philosophers such as Duns Scotus
outlined their positions. Later historians of
philosophy would dub such positions as
“pantheist,” though the more dreaded label at
the time would have been that of heresy. 4 And
yet, as Gilles Deleuze would later note,  these
so-called heretical philosophies are also
some of the most radical ap- proaches to
thinking the major challenge put forth in the De
Anima : the  irreducibility of the relation
between Life and the living. 3.3 THE CONCEPT OF
THE CREATURE In Medieval philosophy, the
concept of creation is shaped by several
au-thoritative sources, including Platonism
as fi  ltered through early Chris- tian thinkers
such as Augustine, Boethius, and Porphyry, as
well as the  authority from scripture in its
interpretation by the Church Fathers. As  the
tale is commonly told, attempts were made early
on to synthesize these sources into a system of
thought that would adapt Platonic philoso-phy
to the requirements of Christian theology. 5
The Neoplatonic tradition,  as developed by
Philo, Proclus, and Plotinus, would set out the
basic terms of creation—Creator, creation,
and creature. Moreover, Neoplatonism would
also stress that the concept of creation has to
do with the relation between these three
terms—a primary or preeminent cause, a process
of divine emanation, and a series of primary
effects. The elaboration of these three
terms—Creator, creation, and creature— may
seem unremarkable, but the distinction of a
cause, an action, and an e ff e c t  i s  n o t e w o rth y  f o
r  w h a t  i t  im p li e s .  F ir s t ,  i t  im p li e s  th a t  a  C r ea t
o r  need not be identical with the act of
creation; a causal agent is not neces-sarily
identical with a causal act. The Creator
creates in an analogous way that a subject
causes an effect in an object. If a Creator were
simply identi-cal with creation, there would
still remain the problem of accounting for the
genesis of creation itself (that is, not the act
of creation but its condi-tions). By contrast,
the Creator cannot be totally separate from the
act of creation, since the Creator is in part
defi  ned by this act of creation be- ing central
to it. This distinction between Creator and
creation (or causal agent and causal act) led to
a number of dilemmas, apparent in the work of the
Pseudo-Dionysius, and in Eriugena’s De
Praedestinatione . Does all

    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 105 creation necessitate a
source or point of origin? If not, does creation
go on  for eternity, or does it stop, either by
“running out” or through an act of divine will?
The distinction of
Creator-creation-creature also implies that
creation  itself—as a process implying
temporality—is not necessarily identical
with creatures. The term “creation” can
certainly be used as both verb and noun,
denoting the (divine) act of creating
creatures, as well as the prod-uct of creation
(“all of creation”). But early Medieval
thinkers such as Eri-ugena are careful to
distinguish different levels of creation, and
more often than not the term “creation” is used
to refer to the supernatural, divine act of
creation, rather than the production or making
of things by creatures themselves. Eriugena,
for example, distinguishes between “that
which cre-ates and is not created,” which is the
Creator, and “that which creates and is
created,” which, in a Neoplatonic vein, are the
Intelligences, the inter-mediary spheres
that create actual creatures from the fi  rst
emanations of  the Creator. In short, the
Platonic-Patristic doctrine of form is
synthesized  with the Christian doctrine of
divine creation. This synthesis culminates in
what later Scholastic thinkers would call
exemplarity: just as Platonic forms are
arranged in an ascending order of perfection
from the perfect Idea to the imperfect thing, so
does the created world radiate from the unity of
a perfect, infi  nite Creator to the
multiplicity of dependent, fi  nite creatures.
Creation is, however, not simply a theological
affair. Even in its formu- lation in Patristic
and early Medieval thought, creation is always
held in a tension-fi  lled zone between Creator
and creature. In fact, it is this term  creatura 
that often proves the most frustrating for
philosopher- theologians.  Thinking the
Creator is, in many ways, a simple
affair—either one adopts the positive way and
proceeds to enumerate the attributes of the
divine (e.g., God as eternal, infi  nite, etc.)
or one adopts the negative path and then 
proceeds to evoke the divine through a poetics
of evasion (e.g., God as that which is beyond all
thought, etc.). What is often called
Augustinian ab-straction adopts elements of
these methods through the simple method of
subtraction. 6 But thinking the creature is
beset by several difficulties, one of which  is
its twofold nature, at once partaking of the
earthly and the divine, the material and the
spiritual, the natural and supernatural. One
question concerns causality and the
transmission of attributes between cause and
effect. If the Creator is taken to be infi  nite,
then to what degree can the  creature—that which
is defi  ned by its fi  nitude—also be said to be
infi  nite?  Does it make sense to say that the
creature is quasi-infi  nite, or somewhat 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    121
    </p></div><p>
    
 106 chapter three perfect, or “kind of” One?
Assuming that every creature, having been cre-
ated by the Creator, obtains in some measure the
attributes of the Creator (that is, that each
effect obtains within it some aspect of its
cause), then to what degree can the
creature—that which is earthly—be said to
partici-pate in or partake of the divine?
Finally, if one does admit that the creature is
in some sense related to the divine or to the
supernatural, then what is the character of
this divine-supernatural element in the
living creature? Is the divine or supernatural
simply a component within a part of the
crea-ture? But then this would disqualify the
divine or supernatural as such, rendering them
as fi  nite, as a part in a greater whole. Or is
there some  third characteristic—and perhaps
this is what the divine or the supernatu- ral
is—that is commonly expressed to both Creator
and creature, forming a continuity between
them? But then this would require a higher
principle “above” both Creator and creature
and thereby connecting them. There is, then, an
indeterminacy that is central to the concept of
the  creature in Medieval philosophy. In this
“creaturely indeterminacy,” the twofold
nature of the creature situates it between
seemingly incom-mensurate attributes (infi 
nite-fi  nite, simple-complex,
unity-multiplicity).  While the creature is
not simply identical to the divine or
supernatural, neither is it simply one thing
among others (for then a rock or river or the
climate would be a creature—a point to which we
will return later . . .). Furthermore, there are
distinctions between creatures, not only as
indi-vidual entities, but within the greater
schema of the natural world. What, then, makes
the creature unique, being neither divine nor
elemental? On one level it is the fact that the
creature is created that qualifi  es it as a 
creature. But many things are created other
than creatures, since creation itself only
defi  nes an action and the relation of cause and
effect. The crea- ture is unique because, while
it may be argued that its essence is of
super-natural origin, its existence takes
place within the domain of nature. And this
existence can only be described as “living.”
The creature is thus not only a theological
entity—a testimony to the  fundamental
relation between creature and Creator, and the
passage be-tween the natural and
supernatural—but the creature is also, let us
say, a biological entity, having its sole
existence within nature and the Aris-totelian
temporality of growth, decay, and fi  nitude.
Already this twofold  aspect is seen in
Aristotle’s works, between the De Anima  and the
works  in natural philosophy. This twofold
aspect is also seen in the numerous compendium
books of the natural world. 7 Though there are
examples from  antiquity (e.g., Pliny’s
natural history books), the Medieval bestiary
con-stitutes one of the central genres in which
the theological aspects of the 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    122
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 107 Life/living
distinction is demonstrated—entries in the
twelfth-century  Aberdeen Bestiary, for
instance, range from familiar species of
animals to mythological creatures such as
unicorns and griffins. 8 Despite the preva-
lence of bestiaries and other creaturely
compendiums, however, the con- cep t  o f  th e  crea
ture  is  rare l y  raised  as  an  exp li ci tl y  on to l o gi
cal  p ro b l em  until the period of Scholastic
thinking. 9 If we consider these and other
historical infl  uences—the proliferation  of
books that classifi  ed creatures (bestiaries
and the like), the establish- ment and growth of
the universities, and the infl  ux of new
translations  of Aristotle into those
universities, it is possible to regard the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries as a time ripe
for thinking and rethinking the con-cept of
life within a philosophical context. But more
than this, what the debate over the creature in
Scholasticism does is to take up the
distinc-tion set out by Aristotle—the
life-that-forms and life-forms, Life and the 
living—and place it within an explicitly
theological context, whereby a  correlation
between two terms (Life and the living) is
ramifi  ed into a tri- partite, or should we say,
trinity of terms (Creator, creation,
creature). In so doing, the Aristotelian
separation between Life and the living is
reframed as a relation—or, the articulation of
this relation now becomes the central
problematic for conceptualizing the
different meanings of life. Let us suggest,
then, that what the life-forming principle (
psukhe ¯) is  to Aristotle, the relation of
creation is to Scholasticism. To the question
“What is the relation between Life and the
living?” Aristotle proposes a concept rooted
in the principle of form— psukhe ¯. But
Aristotle says little  about how psukhe ¯ is
itself formed, or by what means it is able to
express  itself as a life-forming principle.
The exhaustive cataloging of descriptions,
behaviors, and habitats only serves to
exacerbate the question. What is the form of
form, the creation of creation—the Life of the
living? 3.4 UNIVOCITY I: DUNS SCOTUS VS.
AQUINAS I t  i s  i n  r e s p o n s e  t o  t h i s  A r i s t o t e l i a n  p
r o b l e m a t i c  t h a t  S c h o l a s t i c i s m   offers the
intermediary concept of creation, poised
between a transcen- dent Creator and a fi  eld of
manifest creatures. The terms still betray
their   Aristotelian origins, but they are now
connected via a continuum that  presumes an
existing relation, of whatever type, between
Creator and crea-ture, the life-that-forms
and the life-form, Life and the living.
However, as we will see, this trinity of
concepts opens onto still other difficulties,
the most pressing of which surrounds the
concept of univocity. The question posed by
Aristotle, “What is the relation between the
life-that-forms and

    123
    </p></div><p>
    
 108 chapter three life-forms?” is now
reformulated as “If something is held in
common, is  that something commonly held?” The
dilemma posed by the relationship between
Creator and creature  is best summarized by
Aquinas, who provides an account in his Summa
Contra Gentiles  as well as the massive Summa
Theologica . Let us briefl  y  look at Aquinas’
argument from the latter work, for it will set up
an in- structive contrast with a
counterargument from Duns Scotus. 3.4.1
Univocity in Aquinas’ SUMMA  THEOLOGICA In a
group of questions commonly referred to as the
“Treatise on the Di-vine Nature” (roughly, the
fi  rst thirteen questions from the Prima Pars   of
the Summa ), Aquinas considers the relation
between Creator and crea- tures, fi  rst in terms
of knowledge (question 12) and then in terms of
nam- ing (question 13). 10 The former question
deals with whether we as crea- tures can have any
natural knowledge of the Creator, apart from
divine revelation. Aquinas is here picking up a
long-standing debate in the so-called divine
names tradition: seeing how creatures are defi 
ned by their  fi nitude and the Creator by its infi 
nitude, how can any adequate statement 
concerning the latter be made by the former,
without implying their iden- tity? That is, to
what extent does a natural knowledge of the
Creator or the supernatural render it as
creaturely or natural? As we saw in the previous
chapter, the mystical tradition inherited
from the Pseudo-Dionysius takes the negative
path, asserting that we as creatures can only
make negative claims about the Creator.
Inasmuch as there is a positive path, all
knowl-edge of the Creator or the supernatural
is made possible by super-sensible, divine
revelation. Thus, it appears that, while the
creature is of the Cre-ator, it cannot know the
Creator; the effect cannot adequately refl  ect
back  upon the cause, even though it is of the
cause. Aquinas’ reply is a compromise, one that
proceeds in stages. 11 Here he  makes use of a
distinction previously made by Avicenna—that
between  essence and existence, or the
distinction between “what” some thing is and
“that” some thing is. Inasmuch as our natural
knowledge begins from the senses, we as
creatures can obtain a knowledge of the divine
in “that” it exists. One primary way in which
this is done is through a bottom-up approach,
beginning from creatures and working towards
the Creator. One can begin from the attributes
of creatures—as fi  nite, as temporal, and so  on,
and then, regarding these as imperfections of
more perfect attributes, proceed to thinking a
higher being that would condition these
attributes of creatures, a being that would be
infi  nite, eternal, and so on. If the crea-

    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 109 ture is X
-minus-something, then the Creator would
simply be X. Still, any  wholly positive,
natural knowledge of the divine essence in
itself is not  possible, or is possible only to a
privative degree, as a knowledge of some-thing
in excess of the knower. 12 What kind of a
knowledge, then, is this  knowledge of the
divine existence, excluding as it does any
knowledge of the essence of the divine?
Aquinas’ answer comes by way of a focus on the
name. In both a theo- logical and philosophical
sense, to name is to know. Hence we can rephrase
the question: if naming implies knowledge,
what kind of knowledge is ob-tained for the
creature in the naming of the Creator? Let us
suppose that the names of the Creator, or the act
of naming the divine or supernatural, is not a
simple affair: there is some distance and
difference between names and things; that any
name does not necessarily capture the essence
of the thing named; that names are often not
literal but metaphorical or alle-gorical; and
that the divine, as naturally unknowable, may
have more than one name. 13 This brings Aquinas
to the question posed in the fi  fth article: 
“Whether what is said of God and of Creatures is
univocally predicated of  them.” Following the
pattern of much of the Summa , Aquinas offers
three  objections, a general answer, and then
three replies to the objections. To begin with,
Aquinas notes that there seem to be two basic
positions  on the relation between Creator and
creatures—univocity and equivocity. A
univocal relation between any two terms would
presuppose something in common to both terms,
while an equivocal relation between any two
terms would posit an absolute difference
between those terms. Some-times terms are used
equivocally—as when “cat” is used to denote a
me-owing cat and a catfi  sh. Here the term is used
in two unrelated senses  (e.g., the knowledge of
a meowing cat will not help one domesticate a fi 
sh).  One term is, in a way, just as signifi  cant as
the other; their absolute non-  relation
implies their autonomous equivalence. In
other instances a term  may be used univocally,
as when “cat” refers to all animals of a
particu-lar species—each of them, in spite of
individual differences of coloration, amount
of hair left on furniture, or air of
superiority, contains something in common
that enables them to be classifi  ed as cats. Any
two terms re- lated in this way imply an
essential continuity between them, and
there-fore, an essential identity. Let us say
that univocal terms posit a continu-ity of
relation between terms—they posit all
relation . By contrast, let us  say that
equivocal terms posit a discontinuity between
terms—they posit no relation . But here we
already run into difficulties. The problem
with equivo- cal terms that bear no relation to
each other (“cat” and “catfi  sh”) is that 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    125
    </p></div><p>
    
 110 chapter three one could argue that their
very unrelatedness  constitutes a minimal  
relation—that is, they are being unrelated
within a particular context, be  it in another,
third term (the category “animals”) or even a
topic of discus-sion (an essay on equivocity).
Thus “all equivocal terms resolve into
uni-vocal terms.” But the problem with
univocity for Aquinas is that it does not
distinguish between different types of
likeness. For example, there can be a likeness
of identity, in which one thing is exactly like
another; or likeness by degree, in which one
thing is more or less of a certain quality of
another; or generic likeness, in which two
members of a set vary in the particulars of their
characteristics. All of these, Aquinas notes,
are differ-ent from the likeness that follows
from a causal relationship: It is impossible
that anything be predicated of God and
creatures uni- vocally. For every effect that
does not match the power of the agent cause
receives from the agent a likeness that is not of
the same nature; rather, it receives it in a
lesser way, with the result that what exists in
the cause simply and in the same way exists in the
effects in a divided and multiple way. 14 This is
what Aquinas will refer to as analogy. The
analogical relation be- tween Creator and
creature is predicated on their causal
relationship as the foundation for their
likeness. This is clearly not a likeness of
equal terms, but a likeness of cause and effect.
What, then, is the form of this analogical
likeness? Aquinas shifts his view on this
question. His early writings describe analogy
in terms of what he calls “proportionality.”
The analogy of proportionality has the form of
“what A is to B , C is to D .”  Thus what fi  nitude is to
creatures, the infi  nite is to God, and so on.
How- ever, when Aquinas writes the Summa , he
seems to prefer another type of  analogy, the
analogy of “proportion.” This is any term A
which has differ-ent meanings depending on its
uses A′, A″, and so on. Aquinas provides an 
example from medicine, which itself has two
aspects to it: It therefore must be said that
names of this kind are said of God and  creatures
according to analogy, that is, according to
proportion. This can happen with names in two
different ways: either when many have a
proportion to one, as health is said of medicine
and urine insofar as they both have an order and
proportion to the health of the animal, one
being the sign of health and the other being its
cause; or when one has a proportion to another ,
as heal th is said of medicine and an animal
insofar as medicine is the cause of health in the
animal. It is in this 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    126
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 111 latter way that
something is said of God and creature
analogically, and  not by pure equivocation or
univocally.15 Causality—especially
Aristotelian efficient and fi  nal
causality—is central  to the doctrine of
analogy, be it of proportion or
proportionality. For Aqui- nas, both the
positions of univocity and equivocity go too
far, one imply-ing an absolute identity
between Creator and creature, the other
implying an absolute difference between them.
The doctrine of analogy attempts to preserve
certain elements of both univocity and
equivocity, while avoid-ing the implications
each of the other positions entails.
Equivocity is, at a basic level, untenable.
There must be some relation between Creator and
creature, or else no natural knowledge would be
possible at all. But that relation, as
necessary as it is, cannot be univocal, because
such a position is unable to account for the
causal hierarchy between Creator and
crea-ture (that is, between the
life-that-forms and life-forms, an
ontologically fi rst cause and all secondary
causes). Analogy works in between univocity 
and equivocity, positing a partial relation, a
differential likeness. Perhaps we can
abbreviate, and suggest that between the
position of “no relation” (equivocity) and
“all relation” (univocity), Aquinas puts
forth the position of some relation  (analogy).
In this way , the doctrine of analogy serves as a
solution to a particu- lar problem: the
relation between Creator and creature. A
relation must necessarily be posited, which
must contain within itself a fundamental
separation or non-relation, if that relation
is to be thought at all. Now, this is, to some
extent, a feature of relation itself, since the
relation of any two terms A and B presupposes
their non-identity (even if A is formally 
related to itself as A′ and A ″, or as two
attributes of a single substance).  But
Aquinas, like other Scholastics, is not
concerned with the relation of any two
entities; the issue is the relation that in some
way constitutes life itself. What is specifi  c
to the concept of the creature is, as we’ve
noted, its  twofold nature, at once earthly and
divine, material and spiritual, and so on. And
what is specifi  c to the concept of the Creator in
relation to the  creature is the process whereby
the creature is created, the “soul” ( psukhe ¯) 
is ensouled, and Life is made living. This not
only raises the question as to whether the
Creator-creature relation is itself living,
but it also opens onto the potentially
hazardous terrain of suggesting that Life is
living, or that the Creator is creaturely—that
God is a beast. Aquinas, following the
tradition of the Pseudo-Dionysius, suggests
that  if God is living, it would have to be in a
wholly different sense from the life of
creation or creatures themselves. Following
the doctrine of analogy, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    127
    </p></div><p>
    
 112 chapter three we can at most say that “life”
describes the Creator and the creature in an 
analogical sense—in the same way that “health ”
is ascribed both to the practice of medicine and
the digestion of an animal (in Aquinas’
example), so would “life” be ascribed to
Creator and creature. The Creator, as a kind of
super-life or superlative life, would be a
negatively determined life—life without
temporal or spatial fi  nitude, without the
necessities of growth  and decay, and so on.
There are, however, a few complications. The
principle of causality  plays a central role in
Thomistic analogy, and this is due as much to the 
Aris to t e lian  fr am ew o r k  tha t  h e  a pp rop ria t es 
as  i t  is  to  th e  doctrinal  re-quirements that
condition this synthesis of Aristotle and
Christian the-ology. Not all relations are
equal, and in the doctrine of analogy there is
greater emphasis placed on the role of
causality in the relation between Life and the
living, Creator and creature. 16 This emphasis
on relation in  turn leads to refl  ection on the
relation of the relation, the life of the Life-
living relation itself, as it were. The
challenge becomes how to demon-strate a
continuity of relation between Creator and
creature while not im-plying either their real
or formal identity. For many Scholastic
thinkers, the position of analogy was the
common,  and even dominant, mode of addressing
the relation between Creator and creature. Its
general contours had already been suggested by
William of Auvergne, Albert the Great, and
Bonaventure, before Aquinas had formal-ized
it in the Summa . As a compromise, the doctrine of
analogy attempts  to resolve the potential gulf
that could exist between Creator and creature
if one accepted either of the positions of
equivocity (“no relation”) or uni-vocity
(“all relation”). At one end of the spectrum,
one would have to ac-cept absolute agnosticism
and forgo any adequate knowledge of either the
natural or supernatural; at the other end, one
would have to accept pure pantheism, and
conceive of divine and earthly, supernatural
and natural, as effectively fl  attened into a
single form that would disallow any differ-
entiation between Creator and creature. As
Aquinas notes, analogy is situ-ated at the
midpoint between equivocity and univocity,
and it is from this vantage point that both

  Univocal Creatures 113 nally split. As Aquinas
notes, there are two kinds of relation, that
between  one creature and another, and that
between Creator and creature. While we may use
terms univocally between one creature and
another (e.g., to talk about two animals being
“living” or two Shoggoths being “living”),
such terms cannot be used univocally when
thinking about the relation between Creator
and creature (e.g., to suggest that both a
person and God are “living” in the same way). We
can reframe the question again: there is the
relation between the living (between one
living creature and another) and then there is
the relation between Life and the living
(between the principle-of-life and the
life-forms that fl  ow from it). Aquinas is not
the  fi rst to make this distinction, but he does
assert its centrality in the argu- ment for
analogical thinking. Therefore, a single term
X can be used relationally between two terms  A
and B, insofar as both are presumed to already
exist univocally (e.g., an  animal and plant
both related univocally as “living”). This
single term X  can also be used, not just between
two terms A and B , but in two quali- tatively
different kinds of relations a and b (where a i s  t
h e  r e l a t i o n  b e - tween Creator and creature, and
b is the relation between creature and 
creature). There can be no confusion,
according to Aquinas, between these  two kinds
of relations—one is based on a horizontal
comparison between like entities, while the
other is based on a vertical, causal
relationship. Hence, one problem that arises
in Thomistic analogy is, if it is necessary to
distinguish types of relations (the relation
between A and B and the  relation between a and b),
what is to keep us from simply using two differ-
ent terms or referring to two different
natures? For if we persist in using a common
term, even if used analogically (“in some ways
the same, in some ways not”), then, given that
there are different kinds of relations, we are
led to consider the relations between
relations  as themselves being either 
equivocal, univocal, or analogical. This
process can go on forever, with Aquinas’ game of
compromise jumping ahead at each step. In sum,
Aqui-nas utilizes analogy—and in particular,
the analogy of proportion—as a way of smoothing
over what would seem to be the progressive
unraveling of a common term or common nature
into disparate natures. 3.4.2 Univocity in
Duns Scotus’ OPUS OXONIENSE We can state the
problematic of Thomistic analogy in a
different way: given that there are relations
and relations of relations, what is it that
pre-vents the total separation of terms
related, even when, in the case of the
Creator/creature relation, they are deemed to
be fundamentally different

 114 chapter three from each other? This is the
question posed by Duns Scotus. While he  does not
frequently target Aquinas by name, it is
against the dominant Thomistic position of
analogy that his concepts are directed.
Aquinas’ ar-gument is that univocity stops
short because it provides no way of
differ-entiating between entities or between
types of relations. Duns Scotus, by contrast,
argues that univocity “never stops” and that
the real philosophi-cal challenge is in
accounting for the persistence of univocity,
despite the most radical assertions of
differentiation. Scotus provided a number of
arguments for univocity, and it appears  t o  b e  o n
e  o f  th e  m o s t  c o n s i s t e n t  c o n c e p t s  in  hi s  thinkin
g . 17 Scotus’ ar- guments for univocity are all
the more remarkable given their historical 
context. His entry into the University at
Oxford is dated in the late 1280s or early
1290s—following upon the Condemnations of
1277, which were to have a decisive impact at
both Oxford and Paris. One of the burning issues
raised by the Condemnations had to do with
Aristotelian natural philoso-phy and its
implication for a concept of a univocal, divine
being. Several articles attributed to Aquinas
were, for a time, included in the
Condemna-tions, before being withdrawn and
absorbed into an acceptable Church doc-trine.
Other thinkers, such as Siger of Brabant, were
immediately accused of heresy, and a cluster of
such thinkers were even pejoratively tagged as
Latin Averroists. Scotus, however, remained a
troubling fi  gure within this  intellectual
climate, for his positions seem to rail against
nearly all the existing schools of thought,
from Neoplatonic Augustinianism to mysti-cal
theology to the high Scholasticism of Aquinas
and the new Aristote-lians. And yet Scotus
always stops just short of a fully-fl  edged
pantheism  or a fully immanent materialism. By
the time Scotus began to prepare his lectures at
Oxford in or around  1300, the Aristotelianism
of Aquinas had slowly come to gain ground over
the less “scientifi  c” approaches of the
neo-Augustinianism that followed  on the
coattails of the 1277 censures. The split
between reason and revela-tion, philosophy
and theology, could itself come under cautious
question-ing. N o l onger w as reason confi  ned to
gaining knowledge about nature,  with
revelation the proper domain of supernature.
One could inquire as to whether any natural
knowledge of the supernatural was possible, as
did a number of Scholastic thinkers from across
the theological  spectrum— Aquinas, who
incorporated the newly available natural
philosophy of Ar-istotle; Henry of Ghent, who
served on the council that condemned Aqui-nas’
teachings; and Duns Scotus, who directly
attacked Henry of Ghent, and indirectly
attacked Aquinas. We will have more to say about
this in-triguing triangle of relations later;

  Univocal Creatures 115 Scotus’ major
arguments for univocity against the argument
for analogy  provided by Aquinas. The lectures
Scotus gave at Oxford were framed as
commentaries on  what was the major textbook of
the period, Peter Lombard’s Sententiae  
(Sentences ). The Sentences  formed a model for
philosophical and theologi- cal discourse,
posing key questions, providing summaries of
existing argu- ments, and offering
counterarguments and resolutions. Because
they were given while he was at Oxford, Scotus’
lectures have come to be known as the Opus
Oxoniense  (the “Oxford work”), or
alternately, as the Ordinatio   (denoting
lecture notes later reedited by the author). 18
The Ordinatio  is,  like many such texts, a
massive and comprehensive work that spans
theol-ogy, philosophy, ethics, Church
doctrine, and the study of nature. For our
purposes, we can select one particular
question that deals with the issue of the
creature, and which serves as an instructive
counterpoint to the argument of Aquinas given
previously. It comes as the third question, in
the second distinction, in the fi  rst book of the
Ordinatio . As per the tradi- tion of the time, it
follows a systematic approach whereby a
question is posed, existing positions “pro”
and “contra” given, before Scotus provides his
own argument, which is then followed by replies
to the positions given at the opening. Scotus’
opening question has to do with the simplicity
of God: “. . .  whether there is but one God.” In
order to grasp this as a philosophical
question, we can understand Scotus’ concept of
God, as with many Scho-la s ti cs ,  a s  a  d e c i s i v e l y 
n o n - an thr o p o m o rp hi c  co n c e p t ,  p e rtaining  l es
s  t o  a personal God granting salvation or doling
out punishment than to the question of the
divine nature or the supernatural in itself.
With some cau-tion, let us rephrase Scotus’
question: is the Creator (as opposed to the
creature), or Life (as opposed to the living)
itself “One” or “many,” unity or plurality ,
simple or complex? In the context of Scotus’
Ordinatio , this  question follows upon the
question of proofs for the existence of God, but
it also comes before consideration of the
nature of creatures in themselves. Scotus
gives the arguments for there being many gods,
making use of both biblical and early Medieval
sources. In the process, it becomes apparent
that Scotus’ original question is itself
actually several questions. There is, fi rst,
the question of number—is there one God or many
gods? Then there  is the question of
essence—supposing there is just one God, is the
nature of God itself unifi  ed or plural?
Finally, there is the question concerning  God
as known by and through creatures (and here
Scotus makes many references to
Aristotle)—supposing a single, unifi  ed
essence for God, does  this unifi  ed essence
imply God’s univocity with respect to
creatures?

    </p></div><p>
    
 116 chapter three These form the three major
questions that Scotus addresses in the posing 
of the opening question.19 The main body of the
question proceeds speculatively. Let us
suppose  that the divine is in every way simple
(there is but one God, with a unifi  ed  essence,
bearing some essential relationship to
creatures). Given this, can this divine
simplicity, this supernatural Oneness, be
shown naturally, or is such a demonstration
dependent on revelation through faith? This is
Aquinas’ question, rephrased—given the
simplicity of the divine, is there a natural
knowledge of this simplicity? Scotus’
strategy in his arguments is the following: he
begins from the position he does not  hold—which
is  that the divine is not simple but complex, not
One but many. He then  shows how such a thought
must in turn be correlated to the traditional c o
n c e p t  o f  th e  di vin e  a s  s u p e r l a t i v e  in  e v e ry  w a y . 
W h e n  thi s  s h o r e s  u p  its own limitations, Scotus
then shows how every thought of the divine
requires a univocal concept in order that the
divine can be thought at all (that is,
“naturally”). This concept of univocity is
central to Scotus’ metaphysics and his  natural
theology. In the Ordinatio , Scotus provides a
defi  nition of what  he means by univocity: “I
designate that concept univocal which
pos-sesses sufficient unity in itself, so that
to affirm and deny it of one and the same thing
would be a contradiction. It also has
sufficient unity to serve as the middle term of a
syllogism.” 20 We will return to this defi 
nition be- low, when we consider Scotus’ debate
with Henry of Ghent. For the time b e in g ,  w e  c an  n o
t e  t h a t  S c o t u s  u s e s  t h e  t e rm  “ uni v o c i ty ”  in  a  s p e
c ifi  c  way contra Aquinas. Whereas Aquinas
stresses the way that univocity ef-faces all
distinctions, Scotus will emphasize the way
that univocity al-lows for a formal continuity
between terms without simply effacing them
altogether. In the third question of the
Ordinatio  that we are considering,  Scotus
attempts to show, as an implicit reply to
Aquinas, how this univo-cal concept does not
simply homogenize all creation, but that an
internal differentiation is a central
component of the concept of univocity. Scotus
thus provides a means of articulating
difference in conjunction with uni-vocity,
through a concept known as the “formal
objective distinction.” Let us briefl  y
consider Scotus’ proofs for the univocity of
the divine.  In the main body of his reply, he
provides seven proofs against the no-tion that
the univocity of the divine can be known only
through divine revelation, and not through
natural knowledge. The fi  rst proof is from the
“infi nite intellect,” and is roughly as
follows: suppose there were two di- vine
beings, or two infi  nitely perfect beings A and
B. Being infi  nitely per-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    132
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 117 fect, each would have an
infi  nitely perfect thought of the other; that
is, A ’s  knowledge and intuition of B would not be
incomplete or partial, and vice- versa. But
already, the very presupposition of there
being two separate, in-fi nitely perfect
beings implies a minimal, irrevocable
difference between  them, and thus A can never
perfectly think B , simply because B is not A. 
Here Scotus proposes a possible solution,
though one that is almost imme-diately brushed
aside: But suppose we say that A through its own
essence knows B because  of the great similarity
between the two, so that A knows B through  some
nature common [ in ratione speciei communis ] to
A and B . To the  contrary: This answer saves
neither of these two points: viz. (1) that  A
knows B most perfectly, and therefore, (2) that
A is God. For any  such knowledge that is merely
general and in virtue of some likeness is
neither perfect nor intuitive. Consequently,
A would not know B intui- tively or most
perfectly, which is what we set out to prove. 21
On the surface, Scotus’ argument is that there
cannot be more than one  God, if God is defi  ned in
superlative terms as infi  nite, most perfect,
and  so on. The very existence of two such
divinities would be a logical im- possibility,
since their very difference with respect to
each other would negate their attributes of
being infi  nite, most perfect, and so on. This is 
even the case, Scotus points out, if we say that
these two divinities are  related through
analogy, likeness, or similitude, for this
only ramifi  es the  problem. The relation
itself—call this X—would have to be conceived
of  as higher than or preeminent in relation to
either A or B . A and B can’t  simultaneously be
divine (infi  nite, perfect, etc.) and yet
subordinate to,  and dependent upon, a higher
principle, which is their relation X. Thus  it
would not be possible to say that either A or B
were infi  nite, perfect,  and so on. The only
conclusion, Scotus implies, is that A and B are
in fact identi- cal and univocal. Or, to be more
particular, the only philosophically viable
conclusion is that A and B obtain their relation
by way of a nature that is  common to both of them;
their relation is in this way univocal. Scotus’
reasoning here is tricky, for, while he
dispenses with the idea of there be-ing more
than one God, his argument does not necessarily
dispense with the idea behind the argument
itself. That idea is of a third term X common  to
both terms in the relation between A and B . Let us
call this, following  Scotist terminology, the
common nature .

 118 chapter three 3.4.3 The Common Nature of the
Creature The common nature is utilized by
Scotus in nearly all of the other six  proofs that
follow from the fi  rst. The second and third
proofs, from “infi  - nite will” and “infi  nite
goodness,” respectively, replicate the same
argu- ment in terms of a hypothetical relation
between two infi  nitely perfect  entities A and B
. In the fi  rst proof (“infi  nite intellect”) the
relation was  predicated on the knowledge of B by
A and vice-versa. In the second proof  the
relation is based on divine love, and in the
third, on divine goodness. Both involve a
relation based on the diffusion of A into or out
towards B,  and vice-versa. Without a univocal
concept, each term, as infi  nite and per- fect,
ends up canceling out the other term (diffusing
out as infi  nite love or  seeking out as infi  nite
goodness). In all cases, the relation requires
some- thing common between the two terms
without which they cannot coexist in a
non-contradictory manner. Univocity is also
argued by Scotus in the fourth proof (from “infi 
nite  power”), where it is linked to the concept
of causality. Here Scotus argues against there
being two “total causes” of a single effect. As
divine entities, both A and B cannot
simultaneously be First Causes without
leading to the  contradictory conclusion of an
effect that is both existent and nonexistent
(existent with respect to A and non-existent
with respect to B , but caused  by both). The idea
of a total cause bears upon the relation between
Creator and creature; it suggests that a
single, univocal Creator or
principle-of-Life courses through the
multiple instances of creatures or the living.
In the almost aphoristic fi  fth proof, Scotus
makes an argument for uni- vocity based on the
idea of absolute infi  nity, or “that which
cannot be ex- celled.” Here he positions
himself diametrically against the
Augustinian tradition, which had been gaining
some momentum following the Con-demnations of
the 1270s. Citing Augustine’s work on the
Trinity, where a perfection is deemed “more
perfect” if it is present in several,
numeri-cally distinct things, Scotus argues
for “absolute perfection,” which exists
outside of number: “what is absolutely infi 
nite cannot be found in several  numerically
different things.” 22 Scotus is taking up the
concept of infi  n- ity as it was understood by the
Scholastics: fi  rst, in a theological sense  (as
boundless, endless, super-eminent), but also
in a logico-mathematical  sense (as fully
actual, as more than the numerical or the
countable). God, as fi rst being, is often taken
to be infi  nite in a theological sense, but this 
is also qualifi  ed by a logical sense, for if
“infi  nite” means that which is  incomplete or
sequentially infi  nite in time, then God cannot
be infi  nite. Scotus nuances his comment on
absolute infi  nity later on in the reply, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

  Univocal Creatures 119 distinguishing
between two uses of number—number as numerical
and  number as ontological. The former involves
countable, individuated, cre-ated beings—“
four creatures. ” The latter use, how ever , is l
ess coun tab l e and more a number that grounds
thought, the number as a kind of onto-logical
grounding, as in “God is One” (or “I am Legion”).
Scotus’ proposal here is that if we are to think
the divine as infi  nite, then the divine must  be
thought of as “one”; but this is not a countable
“one” but a oneness  that Scotus elsewhere
describes as “less-than numerical”—the
oneness in-volved in univocity. Univocity
then, is not countable, but, for Scotus, still
thinkable as “one.” Up until this point,
Scotus’ proofs for univocity have dealt mostly 
with stressing the continuity implied in
univocal being—that is, the way in which
univocity emphasizes the oneness of the divine
in the earthly, or the Creator in relation to
creation. The fi  rst fi  ve proofs highlight the
con- tinuity of the divine univocity through
the concept of infi  nity, such that  its various
forms—intellect/knowledge, will/love,
goodness/ generosity,  and
power/causality—culminate in the notion of
the infi  nite in itself, or  absolute infi  nity (a
“less than numerical” unity). In the fi  nal two
proofs  (from “necessary being” and from
“omnipotence”), Scotus shifts emphasis from
the continuity of univocity to its
discontinuity, or its intrinsic
differ-entiation. It is hard not to read these
proofs as direct replies to Aquinas, in which
the relation between Creator and creation is
above all an analogical relation. As we saw,
Aquinas proposed analogy as the middle ground,
or compromise, between the poles of univocity
(“all relation”) and equivocity (“no
relation”). The principal problem outlined by
Aquinas was that the approach of univocity left
little room for differentiating between the
strata of creation, and the transcendent
hierarchy between Creator and creature.
Scotus does not explicitly deny the causal
relation between Creator and creature, and
neither does he deny the relation of
transcendence between divine and earthly. He
does, however, take up the position of
univocity as the only viable philosophical
position if the relations between Creator and
creature, Life and the living, are to be thought
at all. How does Scotus balance the position of
univocity against the Thomist  c r i t i q u e  t h a t  i t 
a l l o w s  n o  r o o m  f o r  i n t e r n a l  d i f f e r e n t i a t i o n ?  T
h e  s i x t h  proof provides an argument for a
principle of internal differentiation that is
famously known as the “formal distinction.”
Scotus presents it in two guises. The fi  rst is by
way of an argument for a distinction in any thing 
between its common nature (that which makes it a
certain type of thing it is) and its
individuating principle (that which makes it
this particular thing). Scotus suggests that,
while the univocity of the common nature 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    135
    </p></div><p>
    
 120 chapter three cuts across individual
instances of that nature, it is not determined
with  respect to those individuated instances:
One thing of a given kind is not related to others
of its kind in such  a way that it is limited to just
this plurality or to a certain number of such
things. There is nothing in the nature itself
which requires that there be just so many
individuals, nor in a cause that says there m us t 
be  onl y  so  man y  things  ca used  .  .  .  Th erefore ,  dei
ty  as  such  is  not determined to any certain
number of individuals nor can it be so
determined by anything other than itself, for
this would be repugnant to what is truly fi  rst.
Therefore, deity exists in an infi  nite number
of  individuals. 23 Put simply, in the concept of
univocity, the common nature that cuts  across
individual things is not itself determined by
any one individual thing. The common nature is
not totally separate from the creature, for it
is the very relationality that defi  nes the
creature as fi  nite, incomplete,  and capable of
being related; the common nature is, in a sense,
the con-nective tissue of creaturely life. But
at the same time the common nature is neither
reducible to nor determined by the individual,
created creature. As a principle of generosity
and generativity, it is not exhausted in the
cre-ation of so many or a certain number of
creatures. The common nature is “in” each
individual creature, but it is also not
identical with it, since its nature is to
relate, to point outwards, to render the
interior exterior. Sco-tus caps off his
statement concerning the common nature with a
striking turn of phrase: “This argument, as we
see, is based upon the notion that primacy of
itself is indetermined ( primitas est de se
indeterminata ).” The  creature, then, harbors
both a real, numerical existence (it is an
individu-ated, countable thing) as well as a
less-than-numerical, formal existence (it is
related to other creatures, to the world, and to
the Creator through a principle of univocity
that produces such relations). We might say
that, for Scotus, the univocity inherent in the
creature means that the creature obtains a
creaturely indeterminacy . This
indetermination is further formalized in the
second variant of  the argument Scotus gives.
Let us suppose that there are several entities
whose existence is necessary—that is, there is
some component of each that, if taken away,
would annul not only the existence but the very
es-sence of that entity. Let us call those
necessary components A and B and  so forth. And,
for the sake of simplicity , let us take these as
akin to the abstract attributes of classifi 
catory schemes, so that A and B etc. are like 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    136
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 121 species
characteristics. We can refer to this as a. But,
as we know, any two  entities can be put in
relation to each other based on something held
in  common that is not itself in the species
characteristics A and B of each  entity. We can
refer to this as b. Note that in both cases of a and
b, indi- viduated entities are set in relation
to each other, but in different ways: in a by way
of similarities or differences in species
characteristics, and in b  by a context, event,
or situation that involves them in some way.
Now, one  of the questions Scotus poses is
whether any entity is ultimately defi  ned  by
both a and b, or indeed if b must always follow the
primacy of a in de- termining the nature of the
entity in question. S co tus  ar gu es  tha t  an  en ti
ty’ s  na tur e  cann o t  b e  d e t e rmin ed  b y  bo th   a and b,
because this would mean that, for example, a
could be removed  and the entity would still
exist by virtue of b, and vice-versa. The
entity’s  nature would be divided and
contradictory; an entity would rely for its
ne-cessity on something that could be removed,
and thus unnecessary: If several necessary
beings existed, they would be distinguished
from  one another by some real perfections. Let
us call these A and B . Then  I argue, either these
two necessary beings which differ by A and B are 
necessary formally in virtue of A and B , or they
are not . . . If, however,  these two beings are
formally necessary in virtue of A and B , in addi-
tion to being necessary by reason of what they
have in common, then each being contains two
reasons why it is formally necessary. This,
however, is impossible for neither of these two
reasons includes the other, and hence if either
of the two were absent, the being would still
exist necessarily in virtue of what remains. In
such an impossible situ-ation, something
would owe its formal necessity to what could be
re-moved and still leave the being a necessary
being. 24 Scotus’ logic may seem excessively . .
. scholastic, but it is important to  keep his
overarching concern in mind: the question of
whether the fun-damental relationship
between creatures is a univocal or analogical
one. The only solution, for Scotus, is that
there must be a single univocal way in which an
entity is related to its principle, a creature
to a Creator, and the living to Life. This
univocity cannot be so constrained that it
pertains only to certain entities, for then one
would still have to account for the very ability
to think entities and their relations at all.
But univocity also cannot itself be an entity
among other entities, since for Scotus it is
less that which is related and the capacity for
relation itself. Univocity must be at once
integral to the existence of the creature and
yet not reducible to it;

 122 chapter three it must form a fundamental
part of the creature and yet run through it, cut 
across it. Scotus thus qualifi  es his terms by
saying “formally necessary”  (formaliter
necesse ) or “formal reason” ( ratio formalis )
as a way of simul- taneously designating the way
in which univocity is an integral part of the 
creature and yet not a thing in itself. We can
pause for a moment and outline Scotus’ logic in
the fi  fth proof,  taking a few liberties with the
form of the argument, and our choice of
examples: • Cthulhu and Shoggoths are both
supernatural creatures that really  exist.
(They are thus both “weird.”) • Cthulhu and
Shoggoths, as supernatural or weird
creatures, are dis- tinguished from each other
in several ways: • A: Cthulhu is
many-tentacled, while Shoggoths are without 
tentacles. • B: Cthulhu has binocular vision,
while Shoggoths are  many-eyed. • Either
Cthulhu and Shoggoths are formally necessary
by virtue of  A and B or they are not. • If they are
not, then A is not a formal reason for the
necessary  existence of Cthulhu and Shoggoths,
and the same follows for B. • Thus, whatever
contains A and B is not necessary by virtue  of the
presence of A and B , because A and B are not the es-
sence of Cthulhu and Shoggoths, and neither are
they an  essence in themselves. • If they are,
then Cthulhu and Shoggoths are formally
necessary  creatures for two reasons: (i) by
virtue of A and B , and (ii) by  virtue of their
common nature. • A and B , insofar as they are
principles of distinction that  presuppose a
relation between Cthulhu and Shoggoths, are
not identical to the common nature. • The common
nature between Cthulhu and Shoggoths would  not
be an additive commonality ( A plus B ), but
something  like “supernatural creatures” or
“weird creatures,” within which A and B can
become operative as distinctions. • However
there cannot be two separate reasons for the
necessary  being of Cthulhu and Shoggoths,
since the necessary being is, by defi nition,
the being that is dependent for its existence on
a single  reason or principle.

  Univocal Creatures 123 • Insofar as Cthulhu and
Shoggoths have a common nature, this  is a
principle-of-life. Cthulhu and Shoggoths are
distinguished  from each other by A and B. The
common nature says nothing  about A and B as
necessarily existing, and A and B as abstract 
properties say nothing about the common nature
in itself. • If Cthulhu and Shoggoths were
necessary beings by virtue of  both the common
nature and A and B , then one of these could  be
removed and they would still necessarily exist
by virtue of what remains (e.g., the common
nature could be removed and Cthulhu and
Shoggoths would still exist by virtue of A and B , 
and vice-versa if A and B are removed). Thus, in
either case,  Cthulhu and Shoggoths would
necessarily exist by what could be removed from
it as unnecessary. Hence the contradiction. •
For there to be creaturely life, and for this
creaturely life to be  thought as such, its being
must necessarily be univocal. Even in the
extreme case, in which the common nature is
“many” or “mul-tiple,” the common must resort
to the univocal. Scotus’ notion of univocity is
here presented as actually having three  layers
to it. There is, at the level of the creature, the
individuating prin- ciple or “thisness” (
haecceitas ) of the creature. Then there is the
common  nature, which enables any two creatures
to be related as similar or as dif-ferent. But
here the common nature must itself be
distinguished, between the common nature as a
species, category, or set (the common nature
“ani-mal” enables two creatures to be related
or differentiated), and the com-mon nature as
the univocity of all common natures. For even at
the level of categories, one must still rise up a
level, at which point one common nature is
related to another (the common nature “plant”
related to “ani-mal” not as individuals but as
categories). At some point one will either have
to accept that there are many common natures, or
that there is some principle that makes common
natures possible, but that is not simply one of
them. This is what univocity is for Scotus—the
nature of all common natures. And this is why
Scotus opts for the basic distinction between
the common nature and the individuating
thisness in a creature. Univocity is what
enables them to irreducibly coexist and yet
remain distinct. The question is not whether
one can really separate or render autono- m o u s 
th e  c o mm o n  n a tur e  in  i t s e lf ,  an d  n e i th e r  i s  i t  s
im p l y  th a t  “ all  i s  one.” Presaging later
debates between empiricism and idealism,
Scotus argues for a formal distinction of
entities that is neither simply “in your 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    139
    </p></div><p>
    
 124 chapter three head” nor really “out there”
in the world.25 The formal distinction articu-
lates something that really exists, but that is
not unproblematically ac- cessible via the
senses. In other words, within the creature,
the common nature (that which cuts across, that
which is held in common) is related to its
individuating thisness (that which makes it
this particular instance of some nature) in a
univocal manner. The common nature and the
individu-ating thisness are formally
distinct and yet really identical . At its core,
many of Scotus’ arguments for univocity are
based on the ne- cessity of a third term. The
argument is that any relation between any two
terms A and B presupposes a third term, X, that
enables the relation to  exist at all. That is,
any two terms must have something in common—a
common nature—that enables the relation to
take place. The existence of a common nature
raises a number of questions. The most obvious
one is whether the common nature has a real
existence, or whether it is simply the result of
a cognitive selection (it is not difficult to
see how the question of univocity overlaps with
that of natural philosophy and the classifi 
cation  of nature). But further questions
arise. Is the common nature something in i
tself, wi th an independen t existence, or does i
t exist laten tly wi thin each of the entities A
and B that it relates? Supposing that it is
something  in itself, does it preexist the
relation of A and B , or is it in effect produced  by
that relation? But this argument deals
exclusively with the supernatural domain,  and
only concerns the relationship between two
hypothetically existing divinities. That is,
it pertains to the question of whether there can
be two Creators or two forms of Life. What is its
relation to creatures and the liv-ing? In one
sense, the argument doesn’t really hold when
applied to the natural domain of the creature.
For any two creatures a and b can and  are often
related via a higher third term x, be it in terms
of the classifi  - cations of species or the
hierarchies of the Great Chain of Being. What
makes this possible is the fi  nitude,
incompleteness, and indeterminacy of the 
creature—in other words, its very propensity
for being related. The in- sight of Scotus’
arguments for univocity is that the fi  nitude of
the creature  is fundamentally connected to its
capacity for generating relations. And it is
this concept of relation that is itself
unrelated—that is, while the rela-tion x
between creatures a and b can itself be related
to another relation  y between creatures d and e ,
we must also recognize that, strangely, the 
relation itself bears no relation. The
fundamental propensity for relation in
creatures ultimately leads to a concept of
relation itself under the guise 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    140
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 125 of the “common nature.”
Such a concept, Scotus argues, cannot but be a 
univocal concept. In a sense the question
Scotus poses is whether the concept of  
univocity—of one “voice” ( voce ) immanent to
all creation—can be  thought at all . . . and, if it
can, to what degree this thought is univocity 
itself. This latter is not a question posed by
Scotus, at least not directly.  But it is, in a
way, the question that runs throughout
Scholastic discourse on the creature, in the
clash of cultures between Aristotelian
natural phi-losophy, Arabic commentaries,
and the varying Scholastic factions, from
neo-Augustinians to Latin Averroists, all of
whom debated the status of the creatura . By way
of summary, we can highlight three main
attributes from Sco- tus’ arguments for
univocity. The fi  rst is the idea of the “common
nature,”  the third term that enables a relation
between any two terms to take place. As we saw,
the nature of the common nature itself opened
onto other ques-tions, such as whether the
common nature was a thing in itself or reliant on
the terms of the relation. Univocity implies a
common nature simply by virtue of the
propensity for relation that exists in and
between creatures, a key aspect of Scotus’
natural philosophy. But the sort of unity that
is uni-vocity is not simply a numerical one (and
arguably, not simply a “monothe-istic” one);
univocity requires a kind of numerical unity
that is logical but not simply countable, a
“less than numerical” unity by which the
univoc-ity of the Creator or of Life is
commensurate with creatures and the living.
This less-than-numerical notion of number is
the second attribute of Sco-tus’ concept of
univocity. But even this less-than-numerical
attribute, this near non-distinction between
Creator and creature, Life and the living, must
address the main question posed earlier by
Aquinas: if the relation between Creator and
creatures is indeed univocal, then what
guarantees their differentiation? This is
where Scotus offers the “formal distinction,”
the third attribute of univocity. The formal
distinction suggests that there may exist a
distinction between aspects of an entity that
are in reality unifi ed. For instance, in a
creature, the common nature may be univocal, 
but also distinguished from the principle of
individuation, the “thisness” (haecceitas )
of the individual creature that makes it this 
creature. 3.5 UNIVOCITY II: DUNS SCOTUS VS.

without their own weaknesses, but his
assertion of univocity has a decisive impact on
the Scholastic debate on

 126 chapter three the creature.26 If the
Creator-creature relation is univocal, then
the divine  is distributed in a radical way that
is inseparable—but distinct—from the 
earthly. This alone would prove that it can be
thought, since thought it-self would be in some
sense caused or expressed by this univocity.
But the very act of thinking the divine also
presupposes a certain distance from it, so that
it can become an object of knowledge and a
subject for thought. Scotus is working in a
pre-Cartesian universe, to be sure, but the
Scholas-tic logic of propositions requires a
minimal distance between thought and that
which is thought. The thing that guarantees
that univocity can be thought—the relation of
univocity, even if a partial one, between
Creator and creature—this must be forgone in
order to think univocity as a con-cept. Given
this tension of continuity and discontinuity,
it is not hard to see why earlier Medieval
thinkers such as Anselm took this to mean that
the thought of the divine was impossible,
leading to an impasse that itself signaled the
existence of the divine. The question of
whether there can be natural knowledge of the
univoc- ity of the divine is, on one level, a
question about the knowledge of the  divine in
itself, whether this is possible, or whether
reason and revelation must forever remain
separated. But on another level, Scotus is not
just ask-ing whether there can be a thought of
the divine, but he is also saying something
about the nature of the relationship between
the divine and the earthly, the supernatural
and the natural, Creator and creature. Beyond
the Scholastic dispute over whether there is a
(reasoned, natural) thought of the divine,
Scotus poses a further question—supposing
that the divine is not analogical or
irrevocably transcendent, but univocal and
even irre-ducibly immanent—what would be
required of thought in order to accom-modate
this notion of univocity? 3.5.1 Univocity in
Henry of Ghent The question carries
theological weight, for it asks the extent to
which there can be any knowledge of the divine or
supernatural at all, and, as a correlative to
this, whether such knowledge, if it exists, is
by revelation or by reason. An earlier Medieval
tradition, whose most famous exemplar is
Anselm, denies that any such knowledge is
possible. The divine or su-pernatural can be
posited only as a limit for thought (“that
beyond which nothing greater can be thought”).
Other traditions, extending from Augus-tine
onwards, make room for a particular kind of
knowledge of the divine, but a knowledge that is
made possible by, and ultimately points to,
beati-tude. A tradition of a different sort is
found in the work or Henry of Ghent,

  Univocal Creatures 127 and the differences
between his comments on the creature and those
of  Duns Scotus.27 Henry of Ghent is in many ways
Scotus’ nemesis. Arguably, Scotus’  concept of
univocity can only be adequately understood in
relation to  Henry, and Henry’s position does
indeed form the backdrop for the proofs of God’s
existence and the proofs for univocity in
Scotus’ Ordinatio . As  we know, Henry was deeply
involved in the Condemnations of 1277. He was a
secular master of theology at the University of
Paris, and between the mid-1270s and the 1290s
he acted as the chair of theology (a position
previously held by Aquinas). He was among the
most prominent theolo-gians of the thirteenth
century who worked from an Augustinian (or
neo-Augustinian) basis, and, when in 1277 the
bishop at Paris took on the task of reporting on
possible heretical teachings at Paris and
Oxford, Henry was included as a member of the
committee that helped to identify the 219
condemned articles. In the Ordinatio  Scotus
provides a summary of Henry’s argument,  which
implies a kind of equivocity between creature
and Creator. In the tradition of Scholastic
discourse, Scotus is here ventriloquizing
Henry’s position: The most  general knowledge
we have of God comprises three stages.  To know
any being as “this being” is already to conceive
God in a very  indistinct way; for “being” is
included, as it were, as part of the con-cept.
This is the fi  rst step. The second step consists
in removing the “ thi s ”  an d  co n ce i ving  s im p l y  “ b
e ing . ”  F o r  “ b e ing, ”  in  s o  f ar  as  i t  i s  a concept
and not simply a part of a concept, is already
conceived as analogically common to God and
creature. We are in the third stage, if the
concept of “Being” which pertains to God is
distinguished from the concept of “being”
which pertains analogically to creatures, if,
for instance, God is conceived as a being that is
negatively undetermined,  that is, incapable
of being determined, while a creature is
conceived as a being that is privatively 
undetermined. In the fi  rst instance, “un-
determined” is conceived abstractly as
something self-subsistent and incapable of
being participated in, like a form that lacks
all matter. In the second, “undetermined” is a
universal abstracted from particulars and not
actually shared by them. 28 Scotus’ summary
generally follows the presentation given in
Henry’s  Summa of Ordinary Questions  (Summa
Quaestionum Ordinarium ), this  latter text
written in the late thirteenth century during
Henry’s tenure at

 128 chapter three the University of Paris.
Here, in a series of questions that deal with the 
existence of God, Henry asks “whether God has
being in common with creatures.” 29 Henry does
not necessarily deny that there can be natural 
knowledge of the divine or supernatural. On
this question he and Scotus  appear to agree.
However, Henry sharply distinguishes
different types of knowledge of the divine or
supernatural. There is the most mediate kind of
knowledge, which begins from the creaturely
world, the kind of knowl-edge produced by
natural theology, for instance. This
knowledge is based on individuated, concrete
instances of creaturely life—this life, this
ani-mal, and so on. Above this is an abstract
knowledge of that part of creaturely life that 
is not reducible to or dependent upon its
individuated, concrete instantia-tion. Here
Henry adopts the Augustinian mode, and simply
subtracts the qualifi  ers “this” from “this
life,” leaving us with the abstract idea of life 
in itself, irrespective of any particular
instance of life. Scotus also allows that such a
thought is possible, though, as we’ve seen, he
arrives at this point by different means than
Augustinian abstraction. Here Henry and
Scotus part w ays, for in this second mode of know
l edge, Henry stresses that in abstracting
“life” from “this life,” the relation between
knowledge of “this life” of the creature and the
“life” in itself of the Creator must form an
analogical relation: Hence, because the
creator and a creature agree in any one real fac-
tor much less than two creatures, namely,
substance and accident—in fact, the creator’s
manner of being differs from a creature’s
manner of being much more than one creature’s
manner of being differs from another’s—in no
way can being be something real and common to God
and to a creature . . . Hence, if being or to be is
predicated of God and creatures, this is by a
commonality of name only, not by any real
commonality. And so, it is not predicated
univocally in accord with the defi  nition of
univocal terms, not purely equivocally (by
chance)  in accord with the defi  nition of
equivocal terms, but in a middle way,  namely,
analogically. 30 Henry stresses that there are
two qualitatively different kinds of
creaturely  relations—relations between
Creator and creature, and relations between
any two creatures. This distinction is much
less emphasized in Scotus, though he does not
deny it altogether. In Henry’s argument, the
analogy would be of the type, “what contingent
being is to the creature, necessary being is to
the Creator,” or, “what corporeal life is to the
creature, spiri-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    144
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 129 tual life is to the
Creator.” Henry thus allows for a commonality
of terms,  but he also follows the Thomistic path
in arguing for analogy. What kind of analogy is
this? Following his distinction between the 
two types of creaturely relations, Henry
provides another distinction  between two
types of analogical relation based on analogy
as a formal   relation: [I]t must be noted that the
agreement of one thing with another is seen 
especially in form, and this in two ways, in so
far as there are two ways of having some form in
common. One way is in terms of the same
in-telligibility. This is called an agreement
of likeness and is found in those things that
participate in one form in terms of its reality,
as two white things participate in whiteness
and two human beings in hu-manity. These are
produced by a univocal agreement of the sort
that, as we said, God and a creature do not have in
being. The second is an agreement of form in
terms of different intelligibilities. This is
called an agreement of imitation and is
universally found in makers and their
products, in causes and their effects. 31 The
distinction between the two types of
creaturely relations—between 
Creator-creature and between
creature-creature—is here correlated to two
kinds of formal analogical relations—the
agreement of imitation and the agreement of
likeness. What the Creator-creature
relationship is to imita-tion, the
creature-creature relationship is to
likeness. The former is de-fi ned by Henry in
terms of causality (in particular, its
efficient and fi  nal  causality), while the
latter is defi  ned in terms of generic
similarities. The  agreement of imitation is
similar to the idea of exemplarism, and the
no-tion that any effect bears some relation of
similitude to its cause, by vir-tue of being
caused. By contrast, the agreement of likeness
is based on identifi  able formal comparisons
between any two individuals of a species.  An
important ontological consequence here is
that, by defi  ning univoc- ity exclusively in
terms of creature-creature relationships
(and not be-tween  Creator-creature), Henry
implies that univocity can only ever be 
something that exists “in name only,” and not in
reality. What we call univocal is simply a name
given to a set of identical attributes between
two members of a species. It is secondary to the
more primary analogical relationship between
Creator and creature, and the essential action
of cau-sality defi  ned within it. Thus, for
Henry, univocity is always reducible to  a
nominalism of likeness, while analogy is the
only way to understand the real, causal
relationships that exist in the creature.

 130 chapter three 3.5.2 Negative vs. Privative
Indetermination These are, thus far, the two
kinds of knowledge of the divine or supernatu-
ral given by Henry: a fi  rst kind that begins from
creatures (“this life”), and  a second kind that
abstracts its term (“life” in itself) and is
based upon a fundamental analogical relation
between Creator and creature. But there is
still a third kind of knowledge for Henry, and it
is in the third type of knowledge that Henry
provides the striking distinction between the
pos-sibility of the knowledge of creatures,
and the ultimate impossibility of knowledge
about the Creator. The terms Henry utilizes to
describe this limit to knowledge is  
indeterminatio  (“indetermination” or
better, “undetermination”). Let us  look at his
introduction of this term: But that something
common seems to be conceived by the term “be-
ing” is due to the fact that, whether there is
conceived something that is the divine reality
or that is a creature, when being, nonetheless,
is conceived without determinately and
distinctly conceiving the being of God or of a
creature, it is conceived only
indeterminately, that is, with-out
determining the concept to the being of God or of
a creature . . . It must, nonetheless, be
understood that this indetermination with
re-spect to the being of God is other than it is
with respect  to the being of  creatures, because
indetermination is twofold: one that is
negative, but the other by way of privation. For
there is a negative indetermination when what
is indeterminate is by nature not able to be
determined, as God is said to be infi  nite
because he is by nature not able to be limited. 
There is, however, privative indetermination
when what is indetermi-nate is by nature able to
be determined, as a point is said to be infi  nite, 
when it is not determined by lines by which it is
naturally able to be determined. 32 Here the
term originally attributed of creatures in the
fi  rst type of knowl- edge (“this life”), moves
from its abstraction in the second type (“life”
in  itself), and is now raised to such a degree of
perfection that it exceeds all creaturely
thought. To be privatively indeterminate is,
in a sense, to be not-yet determined, or at least
to be always in the state of being poten-tially
determined. This is the domain of creaturely
life, inscribed as it is by fi nitude and
temporality. By contrast, to be negatively
indeterminate is  to be essentially and
fundamentally indeterminate—to be by defi 
nition  indeterminate, in total, for all time.
Again, Henry and Scotus part ways 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    146
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 131 here, and, in a sense
Henry even parts ways with the theological
tradition  he is referencing: one question that
Henry’s distinction raises is whether
negatively indeterminate being also
forecloses the possibility of revelation or
beatitude, or whether it simply marks the
horizon beyond which natu-ral knowledge
cannot go. To articulate this horizon, Henry
resorts to the language of negative theology.
Here the super-eminent or superlative no-tion
of being or life so far surpasses creaturely
thought that it can only be negatively
articulated (as that which surpasses all
creaturely thought). Here, “indeterminate
being belongs to God by negation and to the
creature by privation.” 33 The highest point,
then, is also the point of the greatest 
negation. The major insight of Henry’s
position is that what is predicated uni-
vocally between creatures can be predicated
only analogically between creature and
Creator. That is, between one creature and
another there can be univocity, but between
creature and Creator, where a different order
of being is the case, there cannot be a univocal
relation. Henry utilizes the equivocity of the
creature in relation to the Creator to
bifurcate the kinds of relationships that can
be known: univocal relations between
creatures (horizontally) and analogical
relations between Creator and creature
(ver-tically). For Henry, claims about
univocity of the type that Scotus will make are
simply confused, a symptom of the limits of
creaturely thought. 3.5.3 Absolute
Indetermination As we’ve seen, Scotus
positions his concept of univocity against
Aquinas, who argues for analogy. But Scotus is
even more explicit in his disagree-ments with
Henry of Ghent, whom he explicitly names in the
Ordinatio ,  where Scotus provides a defi  nition
of univocity. We have already men- tioned
Scotus’ defi  nition in his debate with Aquinas.
Let us cite here the  defi nition in its totality:
I say that God is conceived not only in a concept
analogous to the con- cept of a creature, that
is, one which is wholly other than that which is
predicated on creatures, but even in some
concept univocal to Himself and to a creature.
And lest there be a dispute about the name
“univocation,” I desig- nate that concept
univocal which possesses sufficient unity in
itself, so that to affirm and deny it of one and
the same thing would be a contradiction. It also
has sufficient unity to serve as the middle term
of a syllogism, so that wherever two extremes
are united by a middle 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    147
    </p></div><p>
    
 132 chapter three term that is one in this way, we
may conclude to the union of the two  extremes
among themselves.34 The question being
considered is precisely that which gave rise to
the con- troversies of the late thirteenth
century. As Scotus poses it: “Whether the
intellect of man in this life is able to know God
naturally.” In short, is there a natural
knowledge of the supernatural? Scotus’ defi 
nition of univocity is actually given in two
variations. The  fi rst is more general, in which
a univocal concept is that “which possesses 
sufficient unity in itself, so that to affirm
and deny it of one and the same thing would be a
contradiction.” This seems commonsensical,
almost not worth mentioning. However, a
statement of affirmation or negation can
proceed by affirming or negating a subject as
well as a predicate. For ex-ample, the
statement “the cat is purring” and the
statement “the cat is not purring” affirm and
deny something about  the same thing in
question.  This would be, in Scotus’ defi 
nition, a contradiction—unless the subject 
“cat” was being used not univocally but
equivocally. Thus if the cat in the fi rst
statement is a feline mammal, and the cat in the
second statement  is a catfi  sh, then there would
be no contradiction (but also no univocal 
term). The same follows for statements in which
the predicate is taken uni- vocally or
equivocally. For example, the statement
“Shoggoths exist” and “Shoggoths do not exist”
would be contradictory, unless the predicate
of existing be taken equivocally and not
univocally. If taken equivocally, in the fi  rst
statement “exists” would mean “having a
reality in the literary  imagination,” while in
the second statement “exists” would mean “not
having an extra-mental reality in the world.”
Thus Scotus’ fi  rst variation on univocity has
the simple form of a dis- junction between two
sentences of the type “ A is X ” and “ A is not X .” 
These two statements, taken simultaneously,
would be contradictory in-sofar as A or X is a
univocal term. From this, Scotus can argue for
the uni- vocity of existence between Creator
and creature, Life and the living: the
statement “the Creator exists” and the
statement “creatures exist” can be understood
as univocal terms, insofar as existence means
“opposed to nothing.” In this example,
existence is common to both Creator and
crea-ture, not simply by virtue of their causal
relationship (as with Aquinas), and not by the
participation of creatures in the Creator (as
with Henry), but by the immanence of existence
to both Creator and creature. Aquinas will tend
to bypass this distinction, arguing that any
statement concern-ing the univocity of
Creator and creatures necessarily denies the
hierarchy 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    148
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 133 and transcendence of
the former in relation to the latter. In a
different  vein, Henry argues against
univocity because there can be no common term
between Creator and creature. For Henry, the
Creator and the do-main of the supernatural are
“negatively indeterminate,” forever beyond
the domain of thought and qualitatively
different from the indetermina-tion of
creatures. Scotus also gives another
variation on univocity that follows his fi  rst. 
A univocal concept “has sufficient unity to
serve as the middle term of a syllogism,” so that
any two terms having this middle term in common
are univocally related. This is a more formal
variation than the fi  rst, making  use of
Aristotelian logic. It also has a simple form of
the type “ All A are  B, and all B are C , therefore
all A are C .” Thus, all creatures are living,  and
all living things are fi  nite, therefore all
creatures are fi  nite. This is  all fi ne as far as
elementary logic is concerned, but things get
messy when  syllogisms of a radically Scotist
type are used, such as “all creatures have  life,
all life is divine, therefore all creatures are
divine” and so on. But even in its more
conservative guise, the Scotist syllogism
stresses the role of the middle term, as that
which even those things that are equivocal have
in common. The sticking point is to what degree
this common na-ture presupposes identity
between terms; for Aquinas and Henry it tends
to, and thus one must either choose a compromise
(analogy) or assert a non- relation
(equivocity). These are some facets, then, of
Scotus’ defi  nition of univocity; at this  point
in the Ordinatio  he has not yet gone on to argue
for its real exis- tence. After summarizing
Henry’s positions concerning the Creator as
negatively indeterminate and creatures as
privatively indeterminate, Sco-tus offers fi 
ve counterstatements to Henry’s position. It
is in the second  statement that Scotus
explicitly states that the relation between
Creator and creature is univocal, and then
gives the above defi  nition. This is im-
mediately followed by fi  ve arguments for
univocity. Briefl  y, these are as  follows: •
First argument: “Every intellect that is
certain about one concept,  but dubious about
others has, in addition to the concepts about 
which it is in doubt, another concept of which it
is certain.”35 One  may debate whether the

co n tr a  is  s o m e   concept of “nature” or “fi 
nitude” that is being debated. This is not 
always the case, of course, since many
disagreements amount to equivocal uses of
terms. But, Scotus argues, any debate
presupposes

 134 chapter three something in common, and this
common term is what Scotus re- peatedly
stresses as central to a univocal concept of the
Creator-creature relation. • Second
argument: “No object will produce a simple and
proper con- cept of itself and a simple and
proper concept of another object, un-less it
contains this second object essentially or
virtually.” 36 In this  Aristotelian argument,
Scotus argues for a fundamental continu-ity
between a correlated subject, object, and the
natural knowledge of the latter by the former,
even if this knowledge is established
“essentially or virtually.” Either
analogical or equivocal relations between
intellect and world lead to an essentially
inaccessible ob-ject of knowledge. “With the
co-operation of the active and possible
intellect, any object revealed in the sense
image or existing as an intelligible species at
the very most can produce in the intellect as its
adequate effect (a) a proper concept of itself
and (b) a concept of all that is essentially or
virtually included in it.” 37 • Third argument:
“The proper concept of any subject provides
suf- fi cient ground for concluding to
everything conceivable which nec- essarily
inheres in that subject.”38 This follows from
the previous  argument, but it is also a
radicalized variant of Augustinian
ab-straction (in which the creaturely qualifi 
er “this” is removed from  any attribute;
repeated in the fourth argument as well). Any
medi-ate relation between two terms can be
followed via the middle term to an immediate
relation. It is possible to work from the bottom
up, from creatures to Creator: “In the concept
of a creature, however, no notion or species
will be found to represent something proper to
God which is wholly different in nature from
anything pertaining to a creature.” 39 • Fourth
argument: “Either some pure perfection has a
common  meaning as applied to God and creatures
(which is our contention), or not. If not, it is
either because its meaning does not apply
for-mally to God at all (which is
inadmissible), or else it has a meaning that is
wholly proper to God, in which case nothing need
be at-tributed to God because it is a pure
perfection.” 40 As Scotus points  out, this
contradicts the position of Anselm, for whom a
barrier ex-ists in the creaturely knowledge of
the Creator. Without a univocal concept,
Scotus argues, either no knowledge beyond the
creature is possible, since all concepts would
be equivocal. As Scotus notes, “We would have no
more reason to conclude that God is formally 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    150
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 135 wise from the notion of
wisdom derived from creatures than  we  would
have reason to conclude that God is formally a
stone.”41 This fourth argument is also, in many
ways, the most radical of Scotus’  claims, for it
encompasses the three previous ones by
stressing relations of continuity. Unlike
Aquinas or Henry, he comes very close to
positing univocal being as something “beyond”
both creature and Creator. Insofar as the
Anselmian or Augustinian modes of abstraction
proceed by priva-tive means, they end up
attributing perfection to God. What Scotus
does is to begin and end with the common nature,
the middle term, as the funda-mental component
of any natural knowledge. As a univocal term, it
is less something attributed to greater or
lesser degree to Creator or creature, and more
that which conditions their relation
altogether. Between Scotus, Henry, and
Aquinas we have three positions on the  nature of
the Creator-creature relationship. For
Aquinas, that relationship must be analogical
if it is to preserve the relation of
transcendence, emi-nence, and causality
between Creator and creature. For Henry, the
funda-mental separation between Creator and
creature implies a kind of equiv-ocity, by
which one term of the relation remains
absolutely inaccessible to the other term.
Finally, for Scotus, the relation between
Creator and creatures is univocal, though they
are not by necessity reduced to this univocity.
3.6 UNIVOCITY III: DELEUZE’S 
SCHOLASTICISM—THREE VARIATIONS The horizon
of any thought about the Creator-creation
relationship is pan-theism. This kind of
pantheism not only entails the negation of the
divine, but it also entails a radical
distribution of the divine, such that it cannot
be separated from the earthly, or even the
material (thus the horizon of pantheism is
materialism). The challenge is how to think the
univocity between Creator and creature, or
between supernatural and natural, to the point
of thinking their non-separation, their
identity. Whether this iden-tity is a formal or
real identity is left partially open by
Scotus—a formal identity (the “formal
distinction”) enables differentiations to
exist that are coextensive with univocity, but
a real identity is only a step or two away from
this position, positing an absolute immanence
between the common nature and the
individuating “thisness” ( haecceitas ). In
this sense Scotus  participates in a more
subterranean tradition of Medieval pantheism
that 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    151
    </p></div><p>
    
 136 chapter three stretches from Eriugena, to
Nicholas of Cusa, to Spinoza. The thought that 
is opened up by this tradition is the thought of a
fully univocal relation be-tween Creator and
creature, Life and the living that, at the same
time, does not simply efface or render
subordinate the differentiations between
them. This is one of the many ways that the work of
Gilles Deleuze inter - sects in an important way
with Scholastic thinking. 42 But, as we will
see,  Deleuze’s own engagement with
Scholasticism raises many of the same 
problems, though cast in a more contemporary
vernacular. On a literal level, Deleuze’s
works both early and late often make reference
to Medi-eval philosophers, from the
Pseudo-Dionysius to Duns Scotus to Nicholas of
Cusa. On another, more methodological level,
in works such as Expres-sionism in Philosophy
there is a sense in which Deleuze incorporates
el- ements of Scholastic discourse—e.g. , in
the method of articulating fi  ner  and fi  ner
distinctions in the tradition of the Summa .
However, Deleuze  not only makes literal or
methodological reference to Scholasticism,
but,  more importantly, his long-term
commitment to the issues of the One and the Many,
of univocity and multiplicity, and of a “ pure
immanence,” all serve to draw his thought back
to Scholastic problems. As Deleuze
pro-vocatively states in Difference and
Repetition , “There has only ever been  one
ontological proposition: Being is univocal.
There has only ever been one  ontology, that of
Duns Scotus, which gave being a single voice.”
43 In the  same way that Deleuze intentionally
reads philosophy against itself (as  in his
famous notion of the history of philosophy as a
form of sodom y ), so does Deleuze also recast
Scholasticism in terms of the then-heretical
questions of univocity and immanence (but a
strange univocity that is at once materialist
and spiritualist). Insofar as Deleuze engages
with Scho-lasticism, then, his Scholasticism
is of this “heretical” type, concerned
principally with shoring up the limitations of
analogical and representa-tional thinking.
As a way of drawing out this intersection
between Deleuze and Scho- lasticism, we can
consider three examples. Each can be
considered a varia-tion on a theme. That theme
is the univocity of the relation between
Cre-ator and creature. In each variation,
Deleuze seeks to radicalize the Scotist
tradition of univocity, and he will do so via
what is essentially a Scholastic reading of
Spinoza’s ontology. The fi  rst variation is the
most specifi  c. In  his study Spinoza et le
Problème de l’Expression (Expressionism in
Phi- losophy: Spinoza ), Deleuze rethinks
univocity through the Spinozist no- tion of the
attributes, at once restating and extending
the Scotist common nature. A second variation
is more general, and involves the question of
univocity in itself, most clearly presented by
Deleuze in Difference and 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    152
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 137 Repetition . Deleuze
engages with a dilemma that confronted Scotus:
how  to posit a univocity of being without fl 
attening all distinctions within be- ing.
Finally, in a third variation, Deleuze
provides a recasting of the debate  on the
creature in terms of analogical or
representational thinking. In a fascinating
lecture given during one of his courses at
Vincennes, Deleuze will not only connect the
Scholastic debate on the creature to the work of
Spinoza (in effect delineating a “Scholastic”
Spinoza), but he will also connect this to a
contemporary interest in the concept of power
and affect more broadly. 3.6.1 Variation I:
SPINOZA  ET LE PROBLÈME  DE L’EXPRESSION Let us
begin with Deleuze’s explicit rethinking of
the Scholastic concept of univocity.
Deleuze’s book Expressionism in Philosophy ,
published in  1968, is ostensibly a study of
Spinoza. In contrast to Descartes or Leib-niz,
Spinoza asserts a “substance monism”—the idea
that there is a single principle of being for all
beings, and that this single principle exists
not above and beyond the world, but is fully
immanent in and through it. Sim-plifying to the
extreme, there is a single, unifi  ed, immanent
principle—  Spinoza’s “substance”—that
connects everything, that is, all instances  of
that principle—the “modes.” Spinoza also
offers a radicalized version of the relation
between Creator (substance) and creatures
(modes), one that proposes to collapse the
distinction altogether, in favor of a Creator
fully immanent to all creatures. As we saw, the
central problem in the Scholastic debate on
this issue was how to articulate both a
distinction and connection between these
terms (Creator-creature, substance-mode).
One could posit equivocity (“no relation”),
but then an irremediable gulf would exist
between Creator and creature; one could posit
univocity (“all relation”), but then there
would be no way to account for either causal
relations or differences among individuated
creatures. In a sense, Spinoza picks up where
Scotus leaves off, for, between substance and
modes, Spi-noza offers an important mediate
concept—the “attributes.” Thus the
Spi-nozist framework: a single substance, two
attributes existing in parallel (thought and
extension), and a multiplicity of modes, defi 
ned fi  rst by their  relation to other modes, and
only secondarily by their intrinsic
proper-ties. Spinoza will argue for a single
substance for all attributes, one that is
immanently expressed in each mode.
“Expression” here implies causality, and thus
creation, but it is a creation in which the
Creator is fully imma-nent, a concept that only
implies a horizontal distribution of
causality, but one that also begins from the
notion of self-causality or auto-creation. 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    153
    </p></div><p>
    
 138 chapter three Substance, attribute, and
mode—this is Spinoza’s conceptual triad that  
recasts the Scholastic debate on the
Creator-creature relation.44 Now , Spinoza
uses the term “ attributes” in an unorthodox way
. Usu- ally attributes are either properties or
vehicles: for example, one attributes  certain
properties or characteristics to an entity (an
animal with certain physiological
characteristics, etc.), or one characterizes
an entity in terms of possib le actions that are
attributab le to them ( an animal does this or
acts in this way, etc.). But for Spinoza the
attributes are more than just
in-termediaries. They are not simply
Neoplatonic Intelligences that serve to
mediate between a transcendent Creator and its
eminent relation to crea-tures. This is
primarily because, for Spinoza, the Creator
does not lie out-side of the creatures that are
created, but is fully immanent to them, and also
because the Creator does not relate to the
creature via a nested series of hierarchical
“spheres” that would order creation in a linear
way. Spino-za’s notion of substance is related
to modes via attributes that are neither causes
nor effects. What then, are they? Deleuze
provides one answer: It amounts to giving us a
knowledge of the divine attributes which be-
gin from that of “creatures” [ les attributs de
Dieu à partir des “crea- tures” ]. But its way is
not through abstraction or analogy.
Attributes  are not abstracted from particular
things, still less transferred to God
analogically. Attributes are reached
directly as forms of being com- mon to creatures
and to God  [des formes d’être communes aux crea-
tures et à Dieu ], common to modes and to
substance . 45 Attributes are less mediators or
vehicles of divine causality, and more like  the
very viscosity of relation itself. In
Spinoza’s ontology, the incessantly
distributed nature of causality or creation
means that one must prioritize relations over
things: “Attributes are thus forms common to
God, whose essence they constitute, and to
modes or creatures which imply them
es-sentially.” 46 We are not far from the
Scotist notion of “common natures,”  except
here, with Spinoza, the attributes (or common
natures) imply an inherent, distributed form
of causality, both between substance and mode,
and between one mode and another. Scotus is
hesitant to actually grant the common nature a
causal power, for this would imply that the
common nature somehow causes the
individuating thisness or haecceitas , and his 
primary intention is to demonstrate their
formal, but not causal distinc-tion. In
Deleuze’s reading, Spinoza has no such
hesitation. But what this requires is that
Spinoza rethink causality less in terms of a fi 
rst cause or  fi rst principle, and more in terms
of a self-causality or auto-creation—that 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    154
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 139 is, in thinking of
attributes as a distributive causality,
Spinoza must recast  causality as a
fundamentally immanent principle, in
diametric opposition to orthodox
Scholasticism, as well as to Descartes.
Thinking about attributes in this way, as
Scotist “common natures,”  involves a subtle
but important shift in the debate on the
creature. Earlier, we saw how Scotus’ notion of
the “formal distinction” attempted to fi  nd  a
way of thinking univocity without effacing or
subordinating individuat- ing difference.
This is part of what led Scotus to posit the
coexistence of a common notion, as well as an
individuating thisness. The challenge posed
by Scotus’ formal distinction is a remarkably
modern one: how to think a distinction that, on
the one hand, is not simply in the world, and, on
the other, is also not simply an idea with no
relation to the world? In the Scho-lastic
context, the creature was an exemplary
instance of this problem, for, while creatures
really existed in the world, they also bore a
relation to some principle or set of principles
that themselves did not exist in the world. Each
creature implied some relation to a direct,
second cause (the generation of the creature),
but also a relation to an indirect, primary
cause (that by which the creature was generated
as a creature). For every crea-ture, a relation
to some non-apparent condition of creation;
for every life form, a relation to a
life-that-forms. In Scholasticism there are
several types of distinction, and it is here 
that Deleuze leverages Spinoza’s
radicalization of Scotus. Traditionally,
there are real distinctions—for instance,
between any two creatures, or any two books on a
desk, any two cats, and so on. Part of what makes
them real distinctions is that they can exist
independent of each other (if Cthulhu dies, the
Shoggoths still live, etc.). Then there are
rational distinc-tions, which may not pertain
to anything really existing in the world—for
instance, when one posits the difference
between Cthulhu and a griffin based on their
physiology or general temperament, even
though they re-main purely imaginary
creatures. There is also a numerical
distinction, which can inhere in real
distinctions—for instance, when
independently existing entities can be
counted, added, subtracted, etc.—but which
can also inhere in ideal distinctions—for
instance, one can enumerate imagi-nary
characteristics for equally imaginary
creatures. For Scotus, the formal distinction
could operate at different levels: be- tween a
group and an individual member, between the
universal and the particular, or between two
general characteristics inherent in a single
be-ing. Thus, in the Aristotelian example of
the human being as a “rational animal,” one
could posit a common nature (of being a living
thing; of hav-ing the capacity for reason)
without sacrifi  cing the thisness that made any 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    155
    </p></div><p>
    
 140 chapter three given human being “this”
human being. Between any two human beings  there
is a real distinction . But, within any of those
human beings, there is  a formal distinction 
between, for instance, its capacity for
sensation and  its capacity for thought. Thus
the formal distinction was less than a real 
distinction, but more than an ideal
distinction. In the parlance of the later
generation of Descartes and Spinoza, we might
say that the formal distinc-tion was less than
empirical but more than ideal, less than real
but more than rational. For Deleuze, the
innovation of Scotus-Spinoza was to conceive
of the  formal distinction as ontologically
prior to real or ideal distinctions. This
involves several steps. In the fi  rst step, one
takes real distinction as im- plying numerical
distinction—two things A and B having
extra-mental  reality can be counted as two
things. One would then move from the nu- merical
distinction between A and B to that which they
have in common,  X—that is, to that which enables
their distinction to take place at all. This 
commonality would not only serve to
distinguish A and B , but it would,  at the same
time, serve to set them in a relation, but a
relation of differ- ence. In Scotus’ terms, the
common nature between A and B always points  to a
“less than numerical” unity between them. In
Spinoza’s terms, one can begin from the
numerical distinction between modes, but this
inquiry will eventually require the positing
of some common term, which will in turn imply a
certain numerical indistinction  between any
two modes.  This kind of indistinction is not
simply the lack of distinction, but the
peculiar relationality of univocity
itself—at once relating and separating. As
Deleuze notes, “[T]here are numerical
distinctions that are at the same time real or
substantial.” 47 At this point, however, a
concept is required that is adequate to this 
“less-than-numerical” distinction, this
real indistinction . Here formal  and real
distinction become one: “Formal distinction
is defi  nitely a real  distinction, expressing
as it does the different layers of reality that
form or constitute a being . . . Real and yet not
numerical, such is the status of the formal
distinction.” 48 The formal distinction, as
less than real but more  than ideal, serves to
express something that is neither. But it is
also true that real and numerical distinctions
are not identical: On the one hand, one deduces
from the nature of numerical distinction  that
it is inapplicable to substance; on the other,
one deduces from the nature of substance its
infi  nity, and thus the impossibility of
applying  it to numerical distinctions. In
either case, numerical distinction can 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    156
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 141 never distinguish
substances, but only modes that involve the
same  attribute.49 In short, while all
numerical distinctions are real, not all real
distinc- tions are numerical.50 What is “real”
in the formal distinction is precisely  the
univocity of relations—between Creator and
creature, substance and mode, etc. Univocity
is, in this case, neither a thing in itself, nor
is it a mental representation. Scotus calls
this a formal distinction, in contrast to
either a real or ideal distinction. Spinoza
will utilize the concept of the attribute to
express this formal distinction, as one
between substance and modes. 3.6.2 Variation
II: DIFFÉRENCE  ET RÉPÉTITION In many ways,
Deleuze’s Spinoza is as much informed by
Scholastic think-ing as it is by the modernity
of Descartes. In fact, in Expressionism in Phi-
losophy , Deleuze goes so far as to say that “it
takes nothing away from Spi- noza’s
originality to place him in a perspective that
may already be found in Duns Scotus.” 51 Central
to this sentiment is the importance of the con-
cept of univocity, not just for the heretical
strand that Scotus represents, but for a whole
lineage that Deleuze—not without some 
dispute—extends  to Spinoza, Nietzsche, and
Bergson. In Difference and Repetition ,
Deleuze takes up the concept of univoc- ity in a
way that places it at the center of his ontology
of difference. For  Deleuze, traditional
ontology is predicated on the concept of
identity (vs. difference), of the One (vs. the
Many), of Being (vs. becoming), and so on.
That-which-differs can be regarded only as in
some way falling away from, or dependent upon,
that which does not differ, or that which is
whole, Ideal, One. As Deleuze states at the
outset, his aim is to think the con-cept of
difference not as secondary or derivative, but
in some way as pri-mary to our thinking about
that-which-differs as well as to the processes
of differentiating and creating differences.
Hence Deleuze’s much-quoted project of
“inverting Platonism.” In particular, the
concept of difference is, for Deleuze, poised
against the fourfold aspect of identity
(“identity of the concept”), analogy
(“analogy of judgment”), opposition
(“opposition of predicates”), and
resemblance (“resemblance of the
perceived”). The Scholastic concept of
univocity comes to function as one of the  many
ways by which Deleuze attempts to think against
the ontological  tradition of identity,
analogy, opposition, and resemblance. On the
surface, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    157
    </p></div><p>
    
 142 chapter three this seems con tradi ctory ,
for , if on e w an ted to coun teract th e dominan t 
Platonic ontology of identity, wouldn’t one
want to instead propose a con-cept of
difference or the multiple, or of non-identity
or anti-identity? This is, to an extent, what
Deleuze does, but he does so through a reworking
of the concept of univocity, a concept that, for
the Scholastics, denoted not difference but
identity, not discontinuity but continuity.
We saw how, for Aquinas, the assertion of a
univocal relation between Creator and
crea-tures could only imply their identity and
continuity, threatening to efface the
hierarchy between them. This was also the
challenge that confronted Duns Scotus, who,
though he posited the univocity of Creator and
crea-ture, struggled to fi  nd a way to
simultaneously accommodate individu- ating
differences without fl  attening them
altogether. For the tradition of  analogy
represented by Aquinas, as well as the
tradition of univocity rep-resented by
Scotus, the problem is difference. In Aquinas’
context, the pri-ority was how to preserve the
difference (in particular, the causal
hierar-chy) between Creator and creature,
while for Scotus, the challenge was how to allow
for a distinction (a formal distinction) that
would not col-lapse beneath the demands of
univocal thinking. Deleuze’s proposition is
that only by thinking difference in terms  of
univocity can Scotus’ challenge be overcome.
This basically requires thinking a certain
non-difference of difference, a univocity of
difference: In effect, the essential in
univocity is not that Being is said in a single 
and same sense, but that it is said, in a single
and same sense, of all its individuating
differences or intrinsic modalities. Being is
the same for all these modalities, but these
modalities are not the same. It is “equal” for
all, but they themselves are not equal. It is
said of all in a single sense, but they
themselves do not have the same sense . . . Being
is said in a single and same sense of everything
of which it is said, but that of which it is said
differs: it is said of difference itself. 52 If
univocity is the univocity of difference, then
how is it to be distinguished  fr o m  th e  P la t o ni c 
as s e rti o ns  o f  i d e n ti ty  in  th e  I d ea  o r  th e  P arm e
ni d ean  One? Deleuze offers two axes through
which univocity (as the univocity of
difference) can be distinguished from the
tradition of
identity-analogy-opposition-resemblance.
One axis concerns a phenomenon of
distribution. Distribution is one of the
perennial questions of ontology: what is the
passage from a unifi  ed concept of Being and the
multiplicity of individu- ated beings? The
Neoplatonic response was to separate God and
creatures as the One and the many, and between
them posit divine Ideas or Intel-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    158
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 143 ligences whose
function was to serve as causal intermediaries
between  Creator and creatures. The process
proceeded downwards and outwards; it was thus
both hierarchical and emanative. This is a
“distribution which implies a dividing up of
that which is distributed . . . It is here that the
rules of judgment and analogy are
all-powerful.” 53 This is the distribution  of
Neoplatonism, but it also applies as much to the
earthly or geological  domain (e.g.,
distribution of land or resources) as it does to
the divine. But there is also another type of
distribution, one that attempts to extract
dis-tribution from its being nested inside
hierarchy. “Here, there is no longer a division
of that which is distributed but rather a
division among those who distribute
themselves  in an open space.” 54 What would
distribution be if it  was extracted from the
Neoplatonic order of emanation? It would be
some-thing like a distribution without any
real distinction in relation to that which was
distributed: “To fi  ll a space, to be
distributed within it, is very different from
distributing the space.” 55 Deleuze, using
terminology that  would become more prominent
in his later works, calls this a “nomadic
distribution” (he also refers to this type of
distribution as “demonic,” in that it operates
at the interstices, intervals, and cracks). In
contrast to the Neoplatonic distribution,
which is fi  xed and relies upon a pyramidal, cas-
cading distribution from the One to the many,
from a source to its recipi- ents, this univocal
distribution involves the distribution of
distribution itself. When distribution is
thought of in terms of univocity, what results
is a kind of auto-distribution. In addition to
the axis of distribution, there is also the axis
of hierarchy,  and this too has two forms,
according to Deleuze. There is “a hierarchy 
which measures beings according to their
limits, and according to their degree of
proximity or distance from a principle.” 56
Deleuze’s target here is  obviously Plato, but
it is also Aristotle, for it inculcates the
priority of cat-egory, especially in terms of
how Aristotelian logic was read by early and
late Scholasticism. By contrast, there is also
“a hierarchy which considers things and beings
from the point of view of power.” 57 “Power” here
should  b e  u n d e r s t o o d  i n  t h e  t r a d i t i o n  o f  F r e n c h 
a n t i - h u m a n i s t   philosophy—a   Nietzschean fi 
eld of thresholds and intensities. A hierarchy
of principles  is predicated on a set of
essential properties that are taken to inhere
in  and preexist any creature in which they are
manifest. By contrast, a hi-erarchy of power,
or what Deleuze refers to as “crowned anarchy,”
holds together the twofold aspect of the formal
distinction: a common nature in which
“everything is equal,” as well as
individuating differences through which
“everything is connected.” In contrast to the
dividing-up   of Neoplatonism, then, the
spreading-out  of univocal or nomadic
distribu-

 144 chapter three tions. In contrast to the
hierarchy of principle  inherited from
Aristotle, the  hierarchy of power  or the
relations of difference, intensity, and
thresholds. The concept of univocity, then,
must be thought of not only as a uni- vocity of
difference, but this difference or
differentiation must itself be  distinguished
in its distribution (spreading-out vs.
dividing-up) and its hi-erarchy (power vs.
principle). Where in the history of philosophy
do we fi  nd  such concepts of univocity? Deleuze
identifi  es three key moments: Duns  Scotus,
Spinoza, and Nietzsche. Each takes up and
extends the thought of  the former. Scotus, for
Deleuze, takes the fi  rst step, which is to
assert, the  univocity of Creator and creature.
Scotus’ greatest insight, according to 
Deleuze, is to realize the fundamental
neutrality  or indifference  of univo- cal
being. In the philosophy of Scotus, “being is
understood as univocal, but univocal being is
understood as neutral, neuter , indifferent to
the dis- tinction between the fi  nite and the
infi  nite, the singular and the univer- sal, the
created and the uncreated.” 58 While Scotus was
able to articulate a  common nature, on the one
hand, and an individuating “thisness” on the
other, he was left with no way to think their
relationship to each other. This is where
Spinoza, and then Nietzsche, pick up the
concept of uni- vocity and radicalize it beyond
its Scotist defi  nition. In the case of Spi-
noza, the debate with Descartes is similar to
the debate between Scotus  and Aquinas. Against
Aquinas’ notion of analogy between Creator and
creature, we have Scotus’ notion of the
univocity that runs through them; against the
Cartesian notion of separate substances of
thought and exten-sion, we have the Spinozist
assertion of a single substance for all
attri-butes. But Deleuze also states that what
Spinoza adds to the Scotist notion of univocity
is an emphasis on the generativity of univocal
being. That is, the Scotist notion of univocity
as neutral being is transformed by Spinoza  into
a notion of univocity as affirmative becoming .
This move is, it is im- portant to note,
absolutely central to Deleuze’s ontology—and
he has been  taken to task for it. 59 In short, it
amounts to an ontological assertion of be- ing
as fundamentally generous—being always fl 
ows, is always productive  and proliferative,
is always in excess. Now, there are clear
limitations to such a stance—it is, in a sense, a 
radical Neoplatonism without a center (a
“subtractive” Neoplatonism); but it remained
a position that Deleuze would hold throughout
his life, and, ar-guably, it has its roots in
Duns Scotus and the concept of univocity. While
Scotus articulates the relation between
Creator and creature as univocal, he says
relatively little about how this univocity
transforms the generative process of creation
itself. Presumably, univocity would entail a
mode of

  Univocal Creatures 145 creation different
from either the Neoplatonic example of
emanative Intel- ligences or the
Aristotelian-Thomistic example of
hylomorphism. But it is with Spinoza’s
substance monism (one substance for all
attributes; “God or Nature”) that Deleuze
discovers a concept of univocity  tha t is also a 
concept of creation —superfl  uous, generous,
affirmative being. In short,  the “life” of
univocity , as it were. “With Spinoza, univocal
being ceases to  be neutralized and becomes
expressive; it becomes a truly expressive and 
affirmative proposition.” 60 From the Scotist
notion of univocity as neutral,  we have moved to
the Spinozist notion of univocity as
affirmative. There is a fi  nal step, and it is
provided, for Deleuze, by Nietzsche and  his
concept of the eternal return. Like Scotus and
Spinoza, Nietzsche seeks a concept of
univocity, but one that would remain
resolutely against the theological
prescriptions of transcendence and the
romanticism of the great beyond. Nietzsche’s
solution to this problem is to suggest that a
common notion of being is not necessarily a
cumulative notion of  being—  univocity can
remain neutral (as it is in Scotus), and it can
remain affir- mative (as it is in Spinoza), but,
in order to think though its consequences, one
would have to deny it any teleology. It doesn’t
stop, and it’s not going anywhere (at least
anywhere predetermined from outside). What is
left, then, is not a cumulative being heading
towards some ideal end, but a uni-vocity
becoming, a becoming that doesn’t become any
thing in particular: “Returning is being, but
only the being of becoming. The eternal return
does not bring back ‘the same’ but returning
constitutes only the Same of that which
becomes. Returning is the becoming-identical
of becoming itself.” 61 Beginning with Duns
Scotus, Deleuze builds up a concept of univoc-
ity that is at once Medieval and contemporary.
Univocity is indifferent or n eu tral, in tha t i t
cu ts across ( Scotus ) ; uni v oci ty is also
affirma ti v e an d generative (Spinoza); fi 
nally, what univocity affirms is difference
itself,  a univocity of difference
(Nietzsche). What is univocal is difference in
itself. In Scholastic terms, this would mean
that the two orders identi-fi ed by Aquinas and
Henry of Ghent—the relation between Creator
and  creature, and the relation between one
creature and another—would have something in
common, and this common nature would be
difference, the relation of difference, or
differentiation itself. This would also mean
that the principle of causality that
structures analogical thinking—that is, that
between Creator and creature there is a primary
causality, that then determines the secondary
causality between one creature and
another—this analogical structuring of
causality is really a univocal causality that

 146 chapter three pertains to both of the
relations (Creator-creature,
creature-creature). And  this in turn means
that both of the relations (Creator-creature,
creature-creature) have in common a modality
of differentiation. What they have in common is
the priority of relationality (of relations
over the terms of the relation), this
relationality being constituted through
differentiation. For Deleuze it is
difference, then, that cuts across the
relation of Creator-creature, just as it cuts
across the relations of relations
(Creator-creature, creature-creature).
3.6.3 Variation III: Cours de Vincennes In a
lecture given at Vincennes in 1974, Deleuze,
passing by a “terminolog-ical detour,” evokes
the three terms at the center of the Scholastic
debate on the creature—equivocity,
univocity, and analogy. Deleuze notes that,
even though philosophers have abandoned such
terms, the issues they raise are absolutely
contemporary, as they pertain to, for
instance, the con-cepts of community,
difference, or power. Deleuze outlines each of
the three positions in simple terms.
Equivocity means that “being is said in several
senses of which it is said [ l’être se dit en
plusieurs sens de ce dont  il se dit ].” 62 The
rock, the chair, the animal, the human being,
and God all  exist, but each in an absolutely
different sense. This is the assertion of ab-
solute difference; this is “being without
common measure.” Univocity, by contrast,
means that “being has only one sense and is said
in one and the same sense of everything of which
it is said [ l’être n’a qu’un sens et se dit  en un
seul et meme sens de tout ce dont il se dit ].” 63
The rock, the chair,  the animal, the human
being, and God exist in the same sense
through-out. Whereas equivocity is the
position of absolute difference, univocity is
the position of absolute identity. Whereas
equivocity implies total au-tonomy,
univocity implies total interconnectedness.
The problem, Deleuze notes, is that the
positions of equivocity and  univocity both
edge towards heresy; they demand too much,
theologi-cally speaking. It is better to say
“God is not” than to say that God exists
equivocally, for, if all beings exist in a
different way, then they also exist equally and
without measure. The problem is that this
implies that the being of the rock is equal to the
being of God. Thus it is better to deny be-ing to
God, thereby positing God as superior to and
outside of being, than to say that God is no more
or less a being than the rock. The heretical
aspect of univocity is similar to equivocity,
for both fl  atten the necessary  hierarchy
between Creator and creature. With
equivocity, God exists and the rock exists, and
there is no correlation between them. With
univocity,

    162
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 147 God and the rock exists
along the same plane or continuum. The rock is 
God. God is the rock. We have seen how this
dilemma played out in Aquinas—one needs  to
posit some relation between the orders of
being, but without fl  atten- ing them
altogether. Mediating between them is the
position of analogy, which for Deleuze means
“being is said in several senses . . . only these
senses are not without common measure; these
senses are governed by relations of analogy [
l’être se dit en plusieurs sens . . . seulement
ces sens  ne sont pas sans commune mesure: ces
sens sont régis par des rapports  d’analogie ].”
64 Aquinas provides several modes of analogy,
including the  analogy of proportion (e.g., God
is good and the creature is good, but God is
formally good, while the creature, being
created, is secondarily good), and the analogy
of proportionality (what fi  nite good is to
creatures, in- fi nite goodness is to God).
Deleuze’s central point concerning analogy is 
that it is indelibly linked to category. Both of
the major traditions inher-ited by the
Scholastics—early Medieval Neoplatonism and
late Medieval  Aristotelianism—are
predicated on thought as proceeding via
category, ei- ther in exemplary Ideas or a
hierarchy of species. What is “category” in
this context, Deleuze asks? “One calls
categories  the concepts which are said of every
possible experience.” 65 For Aristotle,  these
might be form and matter, for Avicenna, these
might be essence and existence, and, for
Aquinas, these might be substance and
accident, and so on. Deleuze does not, of
course, assert that thought can take place
totally independent of category, but he does
point to the centrality of category to
analogical thinking. Category presumes
intuited objects of experi-ence, experience
presumes relations of causality, and, in the
Aristotelian- Thomistic mindset, causality
presumes a fundamental separation of cause  and
effect, primary and secondary causes, a cause
exterior to its effect, and so on. Thus, one
impact of the dominant Thomistic-analogical
view-point in the Scholastic period was to have
articulated an essential link between
category, analogy, and causality: “Therefore
there’s no question of a thought proceeding by
categories if it does not have, as background,
the idea that being is analogical, which is to
say that being is said of what is in an analogical
manner.” 66 This is where Deleuze will present
Duns Scotus as a key thinker work- ing against
the analogical-representational tradition
of Aquinas. For De-leuze, it was Scotus who
takes up the position of univocity and follows
it to its conclusions. But Deleuze also notes
that Scotus tempers his position of univocity
between an assertion of being as “univocal
metaphysically,” and yet “analogical
physically.”

 148 chapter three [I]f someone happened by
speaking of univocity of being, he was quickly 
spotted, he could pack his bags; that meant, yet
again, that a chair, an animal, a man and God are
in one and the same sense. Then what: you treat
God as matter? Are a dog and a man in the same
sense? Quite tricky, that. And nevertheless
there is a man, the greatest thinker of the
Middle Ages, who says yes, being is univocal,
that is Duns Scotus. This story of Duns Scotus’
univocal being turns out rather badly—but
happily he took precautions, he said yes but be
careful: being is univo-cal insofar as it is
being. That is to say that it’s metaphysically
univo-cal. He said: sure it’s analogical,
which is to say that it’s said in several senses
physically. This is what interests me: he was at
the border of heresy, had he not specifi  ed
metaphysically univocal and physically 
analogical, he would have been done for. 67 We
can read this in terms of Scotus’ concepts of the
univocal “common  nature” and the
individuating “thisness” or haecceitas . Here
univocity is  tempered such that any
individualized instance of thisness can be
distin-guished from the common nature. But
again we are confronted with the question of the
relation between them, in effect replicating
the  Creator- creature dichotomy. If the
ontological principle between Creator and
crea-ture is that of univocity, then how does
one adequately account for the multiplicity of
differences in and between things in the world?
Should we say that the multiplicity of beings
are merely illusions or Platonic simu-lacra?
If one refuses to adopt the framework of
category-analogy- causality,  then how can
individuating difference be articulated in
relation to univocity? For Deleuze, this
problem is the link between the concept of
univocity  in Scotus and the concept of
substance in Spinoza. In Deleuze’s reading,
Spinoza’s triad of substance, attribute, and
mode takes up the Scotist no-tion of univocity
and extends it further. In Spinoza’s famous
formulation “God or Nature” ( Deus sive natura
), a single substance is posited for all 
attributes (thought and extension), which are
then expressed in differenti-ated,
individuated modes (bodies and their
relations). And what Spinoza offers,
according to Deleuze, is a way of replying to the
challenge Scotus found himself faced with—how
to think univocity without resorting to
category and analogy. In particular, Spinoza
offers two axes by which univocity can be 
thought of alternatively. First, that beings
are constituted by a special kind of
difference, a “univocal difference” that
distinguishes them not accord-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    164
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 149 ing to preestablished
categories or species or genus, but according
to their  “degrees of power” ( puissance ). This
notion of univocity as expressed ac- cording to
degrees of power corresponds to another axis,
by which beings  are distinguished by
affect—the capacity to affect and the capacity
to be affected. Here Deleuze employs the term
“affect” in its Spinozist sense, in which
affect is opposed to “emotion” or “feeling”
(which would take us back to the analogical,
and, arguably, phenomenological framework).
Affect, in Deleuze’s usage, itself has several
aspects to it: (i) affects are external, in the
sense that affects are not “inner feelings” or
something held interior to subjects, but that
which is always tending outside them; (ii) it
follows from this that affects manifest the
primary of relations over the things related,
both in an ontological and epistemological
sense; (iii) as the nexus or tissue of being,
affects are, fi  nally, “impersonal” and
“anony- mous,” to use terms favored by
Deleuze—affects do not so much express the
interiority of subjects as they are themselves
anonymous expressions of a univocal being, a
common substance for all attributes. Thus, for
Deleuze what Scotus starts, Spinoza fi  nishes.
Both work  from the premise that the relation
between Creator and creatures is a uni-vocal
relation, and even that this univocity
ontologically conditions the very
distinction of the terms of the relation.
Deleuze summarizes, citing an example that
would make its way into A Thousand Plateaus : We
have this group of notions: being is said in one
and the same sense  of everything of which it’s
said; hence beings are not distinguished by
their form, their genus, their species,
they’re distinguished by degrees of power.
These degrees of power refer to powers of being
affected, the affects being precisely the
intensities of which a being is capable . . . In a
sense it’s a thought so very far from the
ordinary notions of species and genus that,
once again, between two members of the same
species there can be more differences, more
differences in the degree of power than between
two beings of different species. Between a
racehorse and a draft horse, which belong to the
same species, the difference can per-haps be
thought as greater than the difference between
a draft horse and an ox. 68 In a sense, what
Deleuze does in his reading of Scotus is to
translate the  Scholastic debate over the
relation between Creator and creature into a
modern question about the relation between
idealism and realism. For De-leuze, the most
radical thought is the one that thinks the
relation  between 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    165
    </p></div><p>
    
 150 chapter three the supernatural and
natural, or Creator and creature, as a univocal
rela- tion. For a Scholastic thinker like
Scotus, this thought involved the chal-lenge
of asserting univocity while also accounting
for multiplicity. As we’ve seen, Scotus, in his
debates with Aquinas and Henry of Ghent,
pro-poses the distinction between, on the one
hand, a common nature that exists univocally
across individual instances, and a haecceitas 
that forms  the individuating differences of
this particular creature. Between the com- mon
nature and the thisness, Scotus posits a
“formal distinction” but not an actual
separation. Thus the common nature and
thisness are “formally distinct, but really
identical.” Yet, Scotus’ formal distinction,
while it ac-counts for the difference between
the common nature and the individuat-ing
thisness, says little about their connection
or their coexistence. Al-though Scotus does
make the move of positing the univocity of
being, this univocity still remains tethered
to the Thomistic framework of category,
analogy, and causality. One can view things
analogically, from the point of view of
creatures, Scotus admits, but the key thing is
to move from the creaturely view to the view of
the relation between creature and Creator, and
to see this relation as essentially
continuous, and hence, univocal. This
ontological commitment also has the effect of
problematizing  Deleuze’s Scholasticism. The
appeal to univocity in terms of a continuum  w o u l
d  s e e m  t o  p u s h  D e l e u z e ’ s  p h i l o s o p h y  i n t o  e i t h e r 
a n  i m m a n e n t i s t  mysticism (in which the thought
of univocity would become isomorphic wi th  uni v
oc i ty ,  l os ing  all  “ d e fi  nition”) or into a
sophistic hyperbole, an  exploration of the
twists and turns of aporia and contradiction.
Medieval  and Scholastic philosophy often fi 
nds itself in a similar position, poised 
between mystical theology and the logical
rigor of the Summa . It would not be difficult to
argue that Deleuze’s major works attempt  to do
both, continually generating concepts while
also undertaking “fi  ner  and fi  ner
distinctions.” This is where, for Deleuze,
Spinoza’s ontology en- ters the scene. Spinoza
reframes Scotus’ pairing between the common
na-ture and individuating thisness into a
triad of terms: a single substance, for all
attributes, that express individuated modes.
In so doing, Spinoza also does what Scotus does
not do, which is to place the idea of univocity
within a framework that is not that of analogy.
What replaces the frame-work of category is
relation, and in particular the twofold axis of
relation-ships of power and the circulation of
affects. Thus the means by which creatures are
comprehended as univocal is less along the
lines of species and genus, and more along the
lines of power (relations of intensity,
rela-tions of relations) and affect (the
capacity to affect and to be affected).

  Univocal Creatures 151 3.7 UNIVOCAL CREATURES
Inasmuch as the concepts of Creator and
creature are about their relation,  we can
suggest that univocity implies all relation,
while equivocity im-plies no relation. A
univocal relation between Creator and
creature would imply, in Aquinas’ view, a
continuity of being between Creator and
crea-ture, and this continuity would, in turn,
imply an equality of being, ef-fectively fl 
attening the relation of causal transcendence
between Creator  and creature. By contrast, an
equivocal relation between Creator and
crea-ture would imply the inverse, a radical
discontinuity between Creator and creature,
in which both would exist in an absolutely
unrelated and differ-ent sense. A creature is a
being and a Creator is a being, without any
rela-tionship between one and the other
whatsoever. Reducing to the extreme, we can say
that univocity (all relation) points to the
view that “all is one,” while equivocity (no
relation) points to a view that is something
like the phrase “to each their own.” Univocity
is compromised by the fact that, while it fl 
attens the Creator-creature distinction, it
must still account for  causal relationships in
the creation of the creature by the Creator.
Like-wise, equivocity is compromised by its
assertion of absolute non-relation, which
itself becomes a relation. Both positions, for
Aquinas, pose signifi  cant problems for
thinking  about the creature, especially if we
bear in mind the way that the Scholas-tic pair of
Creator-creature extends the Aristotelian
pair Life-living. Aqui-nas’ primary interest
is in adequately articulating their relation.
While he does not deny the difficulty in
thinking the concept of univocity, Scotus
takes up the concept in a way that is almost
opposite to that of Aquinas. His primary
interest is in adequately articulating the
creature between the two axes of
Creator-creature and creature-creature. For
Aquinas, what has to be accounted for is the
relation between Creator and creature in a way
that would preserve the causal hierarchy
between them. What can-not be allowed in
Aquinas’ argument is any fundamental
indistinction be-tween Creator and creature,
the supernatural and the natural, Life and the
living, Primary and Secondary cause—whether
this indistinction be real, numerical, or
formal. The same can be said of Henry’s
arguments, though, as we’ve seen, Henry also
argues against Aquinas. For Henry what can-not
be allowed is any fundamental
indistinction—thus his statement that what
appears to natural knowledge to be a single
thing is really a confused perception of two
kinds of things (one as “negatively
indeterminate” and the other as “privatively
indeterminate”).
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    167
    </p></div><p>
    
 152 chapter three For Scotus, what has to be
accounted for is not so much the relation 
between the two entities Creator and creature,
but the entities situated be- tween two or more
relations. Let us read Scotus as a
contemporary. Scotus, at once taking up the
thread of univocity , and pushing it forward to
Spi-noza, comes very close at times to implying
the ontological priority of re-lation to the
terms related. Even the relation between
Creator and creature presupposes some common
term, some common nature, through which they
are at once linked and distinguished from each
other. At its furthest reaches, Scotus’
philosophy returns to this common term, this
univocity, but without ever forgoing the
creaturely manifestations from which it can
never be totally separated. This dual
commitment is worth pausing on. It implies a
thought of univocity (“all relation”; Life,
that-which-forms) that is inseparable from
the concept of the creature (as living, as
life-forms, as temporality, as fi  nitude). The
arguments for univocity developed by Scotus 
lead to the paradoxical notion of a univocal
creature . A univocal creature  would be a
creature that, by its very contingency as
living, as a life-form, as  “creaturely
indeterminacy,” would equally express
univocity. That which is, by defi  nition,
contingently living, is also necessarily
Life. A univocal  creature is not simply any
given creature that exists in a univocal
relation with another creature; rather, it is
the concept of the creature as a kind of nexus in
which relation is already actualized as prior
to its terms. 69 Within the concept of the
univocal creature lies a contradiction—the 
living that is constrained on all sides by Life.
The univocal creature, as a sort of living
contradiction, opens onto a series of similar
concepts. Let us extend this a bit further. In
Scotus’ proofs for univocity, there is a brief
comment about the way in which a creature is
unable to have any ade-quate knowledge of that
which is “uncreated”: No object will produce a
simple and proper concept of itself and a sim-
ple and proper concept of another object,
unless it contains this second object
essentially or virtually. No created object,
however, contains the Uncreated [ increatum ]
essentially or virtually—at least in the way
that  the two are actually related, namely as
what is by nature secondary is related to what is
by nature prior.” 70 On the surface, this simply
means that a creature can have no adequate 
knowledge of anything that does not imply its
being created, and thus “es-sentially” or
“virtually” related to the Creator. But it is
difficult not to ask the question—what would a
creaturely knowledge of the uncreated be like?
Would such an “uncreaturely” knowledge still
be univocal? That is, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    168
    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 153 would there exist a
univocal relation between the creature (that
which is  created) that the “uncreature” (that
which exists as uncreated)? Would the creature
then obtain an immanent and univocal relation
to that which is its negation, resulting in a
kind of uncreated univocity ? In the Scholastic
tradition, the creature is not only that which
is cre- ated, but also that which is related. As
created, the creature is defi  ned by  its fi
nitude, by its being incomplete,
indeterminate. As such, this fi  nitude, 
incompleteness, and indetermination of the
creature means that it has a certain openness.
The creature is neither total nor absolute, and
it is by virtu e  o f  thi s  th a t  i t  e xi s t s  r e l a t i o n
all y .  T h u s  th e  c r ea tur e  i s  fi  nite and  open,
indeterminate and relational. Now, while the
analogical approach  makes of these
characteristics part of a whole creature (so
that the fi  nite  part is the animal life and the
open part is the soul), the approaches of uni-
vocity and equivocity assert the identity of
the twofold attributes of the fi nite and the
open, the indeterminate and the relational.
But then, one  would have to entertain the idea of
a creature that is at once individuated  and
actualized, and yet fully exteriorized and
fully distributed—one can only think of a kind
of inverted creature, or a kind of exploding
creature, or better, a kind of “cosmic animal”
that would not be separate from ei-ther nature
or supernature. A univocal creature would be a
creature that maximizes this tension between
its fi  nitude and openness, its indetermi- nacy
and its propensity for relations—not as
quantized parts of a theologi-cal  w h o l e ,  b u t  a s 
co e xt e n s i v e  a t tri b u t es  tha t  r es i s t  b o th  p ur e  s
p iri t  an d  pure matter. The same follows for the
inverse concept—the equivocal creature— 
except here the tension is maximized in a way
that forecloses any com- mon term at all, a kind
of absolute negation between any two entities,
a relation of non-relation (or a relation of the
void). Recall that the key ques-tion of this
debate is whether the relation between Creator
and creature, or between Life and the living,
was one of univocity (all relation),
equivocity (no relation), or analogy (some
relation). For Deleuze, it is the position of
univocity that is the most radical. Why is this?
Because with univocity one must think of
Creator and creature not in terms of
transcendence, and not even in terms of
eminence or emanation, but in terms of
immanence. Creator and creature, the divine
and earthly, the supernatural and natural,
Life and the living—each term is fully immanent
in relation to the other. This is a difficult
thought indeed, for it requires thinking that
which is “above” the human as equal to that which
is “below” the human. The angel and the insect
both exist immanently. As Deleuze notes, “God
is a tick” (or, perhaps, God is a swarm . . .).
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
 154 chapter three So, when we think about the
creature in this sense, what we have to  think
about is neither the individuated creature nor
the universal Cre- ator, but that it is the
relation that constitutes the living as
that-which-is-  living, and Life as
that-by-which-the-living-is-living. There
is a “univocal  creature,” not because an
individual animal is living, and not because a
universal principle of Life guarantees the
living. Instead, the creature is univocal
because, in a sense, the relationship between
Life and the living is actually a non-relation,
compressed into a single, continuous
“voice”—une voce . The life “after life” is
another way of saying that the relation  between
Life and the living is a univocal relation— and
thus not really  a relation at all . “No
relation”—is this not the opposite position,
that of  equivocity? On the surface of things, it
seems that we have passed from  univocity to
equivocity. This is the other alternative that
Deleuze’s Vincennes lectures fur- tively
point to, for while Deleuze never explicitly
took up the position of equivocity, implicitly
all the talk of univocity and immanence moves
towards this horizon. Equivocity has its own
tradition, just as univocity does. The
position of equivocity can be traced back to the
“divine names” tradition in mystical
theology, of which the Pseudo-Dionysius is the
most common reference. The divine is, by this
defi  nition, absolutely inaccessi- ble to
human understanding. Anselm would later
formalize this inacces-sibility in the
so-called ontological proof for God’s
existence. Arabic phi-losophy would also
explore equivocity, in a mystical vein in
Suhrawardı ¯,  and in a more analytical vein in
Avicenna. Equivocity posits no common terms
between Creator and creature,  Life and the
living. Equivocity is blank thought, the
thought of the neu-tral. Being is said in
several senses, each in its own way,
indifferent to each other instance. Perhaps
equivocity is even more enigmatic than
univocity. Where univocity posited the
breakdown of all category, equivocity posits a
God, a Being, a Life, that cannot be posited.
This strange Being that does not exist, this
Life that is not living, is at once necessary for
thought itself to continue, but remains the
absolute void that cannot be thought. Not
existing in itself, but also not not existing.
At once foundational and yet, in itself,
nothing. Life as anonymous, indifferent, a
void . . . the thought of the relation between
Life and the living as equivocal opens onto the
notion of an equivocal inexistence , in which
the creature is absolutely dif- ferentiated
from Creator. 71 In fact, it is, perhaps, in
their point of intersection that the dichotomy 
between Life and the living can be broken down.
This is, arguably, the central point in
Deleuze’s reading of Scholasticism, and also

point at which univocity becomes isomorphic
with  equivocity,  the point at which “all
relation” becomes isomorphic with “no 
relation.”  This is precisely the moment in
which the question of life be- comes evocative
for Scholasticism. In the dichotomized space
between the  supernatural and natural, the
divine and earthly, either there is an
abso-lute gulf in which that which exists only
exists equivocally, or there is an absolute
continuum in which all is one: Prefi guring the
relations between man and the infi  nite, the
natural  relation unites the living being with
life. Life, in the fi  rst instance,  seems to
exist only through and within the living being,
within the  individual organism that puts it in
action . . . That is to say that uni-versality,
the community of life, denies itself, gives
itself to each living being as a simple outside,
an exteriority that remains foreign to it, an
Other. 72 A g a i n ,  i n a s m u c h  a s  t h e  q u e s t i o n  o f  l i f

about what we would call biological or animal
life, it increas-ingly becomes a question of
some principle that is able to mediate between
the purely material and the purely spiritual.
In Scholasticism, Life is more than Being but
less than God. But this is too general a
statement. We should really say that insofar as
the questions of the nature of Being and the
nature of God were a primary question for
Medieval philosophy, the debate surrounding
the Creator-creation relationship became a
key point of mediation between them. That this
debate is signifi  cantly shaped by  the
Scholastic reception of Aristotelian natural
philosophy means that the co n c e p t  o f  lif e  co m es 
t o  b e  m u c h  m o r e  than  c la s s ifi  cation and
descrip- tion of the natural world. As we’ve
seen, life becomes primarily an issue of form,
and the nature of the relationship between that
which forms (or, the life-that-forms) and that
which is formed (or, life-forms). For the
Scho-lastics, the concept of life becomes a
concept that seeks an ontological grounding in
Being, and a theological grounding in God, but
which retains something in excess of either of
these terms. But what is this “something more”
or “something other”? Is it some  further
attribute that would distinguish Life from
Being or God? Or must it remain shrouded in
mysticism, amounting to a negative defi  nition
(e.g.,  “Life is that which is in excess of, but
irreducible to, Being or God”)? This is where
the debate on univocity-equivocity-analogy
becomes relevant, for each position says
something about what this “something other”
than Be-ing or God is. It is not difficult to see
how the position of analogy, for-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

 156 chapter three malized here by Aquinas,
offers a way out of the apparent nihilism of 
univocity/equivocity. Thomistic analogy is
thus a kind of apology for the creature. Against
the notion of an equivocal inexistence (the
creature in and as the void, as it were), the
doctrine of analogy asserts an essential
relation between Creator and creature, Life
and the living. And, against the notion of a
univocal creature, the position of analogy
preserves the re-lationship of causal
priority and hierarchy between Creator and
creature. Only analogy offers a sufficiently
adequate human view of the relation between the
supernatural and natural, divine and earthly.
It does this by asserting that the relation
between Creator and creature exists solely by
virtue of causality. Here causality is taken in
its Aristotelian guise, stress-ing efficient
and fi  nal causality, but it is also mixed with
Neoplatonic and  Avicennian notions of an
emanating causality. That causality of this
sort is the sole arbiter between the Creator and
the creature means that causal-ity is in turn
predicated on relations of exteriority: each
cause external to its effect, all the way up to
the First Cause, which itself is uncaused. The
concept of life seems to forever come up against
boundaries be- yond which it simply becomes a
matter of either classifi  cation or rev-
elation. Perhaps this is why so few Scholastic
philosophers went all the  way in support of
univocity, and why nearly none throw in their
support for equivocity. We should also remind
ourselves of the inherent
non-anthropomorphic tendencies of
Scholastic heretical thinking in this
re-gard. The question of the creature is not a
metonym for any humanist crisis or the question
of the human being’s place in the world. The fi 
ni- tude of the creature is not defi  ned by any
anguish or privileging of the  human. Neither is
its openness a sign of the innate sociability of
the crea-ture. Quite the opposite—the
question of the creature bears upon the
re-lation between Life and the living in a way
that arcs across the scale of the human being.
The positions of univocity and equivocity are
difficult thoughts precisely because they ask
us to think about the Creator-creature
relation, or the Life-living relation, in a way
that is both above and below the scale of the
human. 3.8 ELLIPSES: DO ¯GEN AND UNCREATED
UNIVOCITY While the Thomistic synthesis of
Aristotle and theology would not go without its
own controversies, the emphasis on the
relation of analogy be-tween Creator and
creature would gradually become the dominant
posi-tion in post-Aristotelian
Scholasticism. The Thomistic position of
analogy constructs a framework of theological
(or really, theologico-political) tran-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
  Univocal Creatures 157 scendence that is
enabled by Aristotelian hylomorphism. One
conserves  the hierarchy of relations implicit
in the process of creation and produc-tion,
while also allowing for a more logically
rigorous means by which this hierarchy of
relations is conserved. Rarely if ever does one
encounter an assertion of either full
univocity or full equivocity, in spite of the
mod-ern readings that have been offered here of
Duns Scotus. To the extent that there was really
a debate, it comes to look more like a series of
unten-able hypotheses that are passed over in
favor of the edifi  ce of high Scholas- ticism, as
displayed in the Summa Theologica. But even the
positions of univocity and equivocity are
still subsumed  within the larger topic of form,
causality, and production. Hence a ques- tion:
what would it mean to think life in terms of the
limit-concepts of univocity and equivocity,
but without the overarching framework of
pro-duction (Creator, creating, creature)?
This would be tantamount to inquir-ing into the
points where univocity overlaps with, and
becomes identical with, equivocity, the
“everywhere” overlapping with the “nowhere.”
Perhaps the various traditions in Buddhist
thinking provide one way of  doing this. Do ¯gen
Zenji, the thirteenth-century Japanese
teacher and phi- losopher, is commonly known as
the founder of the school of So ¯to¯ Zen. He  is
also known for his emphasis on a technique of
seated meditation that  has come to be closely
identifi  ed with Zen Buddhism. Both Do ¯gen ’ s m
ed- itation manuals, as well as his most
well-known work, the Sho¯bo ¯genzo ¯, 
emphasize the role of the Buddhist concept of
“emptiness,” not only in an  epistemological
sense (in terms of enlightenment), but, as a
property of the world in itself. Emptiness has
several meanings for Do ¯gen. It applies to the
subject,  which is neither fi  xed nor static, and
least of all defi  ned by any innate  or essential
characteristics; the subject is an effect, not
a cause. Empti-ness also applies to the
noumenal world of things-in-themselves. One
of Do¯gen’s preferred phrases is “the nature of
things,” a phrase that includes  the natural and
spiritual worlds together: “All living
beings, for infi  nite  eons, have never left
absorption in the nature of things. ” 73 Here the
“na- ture of things” is that any discrete thing
is in itself indefi  nable, in that it  is preceded
by a cluster of relations—and here the
emptiness of the sub-ject coincides with the
emptiness of the world, both ultimately
dissolved by this priority of relation.
Finally, emptiness also inheres in the
relation between self and world, the self
always positing something about a world that,
by defi  nition, must remain in part
inaccessible to the self. Together,  these
facets of emptiness reveal themselves in what
Do ¯gen calls “ absorp- tion in the nature of
things. ” 74 What emptiness is, is also the
process of 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    173
    </p></div><p>
    
 158 chapter three  emptying—emptying the self,
the world, the self-world relation. This is  an
enigmatic kind of totality, at once
omnipresent and yet omni-evasive. “This
totality of phenomena  and the nature of things
are far beyond any  question of sameness or
difference, beyond talk of distinction or
identity . . .  is not past, present, or future,
not annihilation or eternity . . .” 75 To these Do
¯gen will add a fi  nal  typ e  o f  e m p tin es s ,  w hi c h  i s 
tha t  o f   emptiness in itself (that is, the
dissolution of the “in itself” of emptiness,
without any positive content). This
emptiness, which seems to be at once univocal to
all things, and yet equivocal to any one of them,
has no con-tent in and of itself. It does not
itself become a relation, a thing in the world,
or a self: “In the nature of things there are no
heretics or demons— it is only eating
breakfast, eating lunch, having a snack .” 76
But then this  is  lik e  sa ying  tha t  th e  r e la ti o n  b e
tw een  C r ea t o r  an d  cr ea tur e  is  a t  o n ce   fully
continuous, and yet fully discontinuous.
There can be no Creator, since there is only a
single, univocal continuum of creation and
creativity; likewise, there is also no
creature, since the creature is simply an
effect of this continuum. Life is far from
natural and organismic life, but becomes
nearly indissociable from a concept of being.
As Do ¯gen notes , “ [A]ll living  beings do not
leave living beings .” 77 But neither should we
rest at the point  of there being pure creation or
creativity, since such terms presuppose
ba-sic relations of causality that require, in
some shape or form, a Creator and creature.
What, then, persists? Perhaps it is Do ¯gen’s
fourth type of “empti- ness” that persists, and
that is univocal-equivocal. Here we would have 
to think the concepts of univocity and
equivocity as subtracted from the conceptual
framework of form, causality, and production.
This would be akin to thinking something like an
uncreated univocity , or, alternately,  an
equivocal emptiness . In the concept of
emptiness, Do ¯gen poses the question that is
the great- est threat to philosophy—or at least
the question that always threatens to
undermine thought as specifi  cally
philosophical. That is the question  of
absolute relation—to assert the priority of
relation (over self, over the world, over
relations themselves) is also to assert a
fundamental empti-ness that is  this relation.
The question that Do ¯gen raises is to what
extent  “emptiness” in all its connotations is
also the univocity of emptiness. Can an
ontology of life account for this fourth type of
emptiness? “If you call living beings living
beings, it is if you speak of it as something, you
miss it. Speak quickly, speak quickly!” 78

 159Why do human beings expect an end of the world
at all? And if this is  conceded to them, why must
it be a terrible end?—Kant 4.1 EVERYTHING AND
NOTHING Our inquiry into the concept of life
began from a deceptively simple   question—the
degree to which “life” can be an object of
philosophical  inquiry. This led us, in our
introductory comments, to the distinction be-
tween that-which-is-living and
that-by-which-the-living-is-living, or,
more simply, the living and Life. The latter
term denotes a general principle that grounds
or conditions the specifi  c instances of the
former, while remain- ing itself
inaccessible. In the second chapter, we saw how
this delineated  a structure of thought
equivalent to negative theology. But we have
also seen that these two terms exist in relati on
to each other . Hence, in the third chapter, we
were led to the problem of how to think the
distinction between Life and the living while
at the same time thinking their relation and
co-relation. This problem is that of the
relation between Creator and creature found in
Scholastic discourse of the twelfth and
thirteenth cen-turies (analogy, equivocity,
and univocity). In the second chapter, the
con-cept of life was split between Life and the
living, with the former placed forever beyond
thought in a domain that was essentially that of
the di-vine itself. In the third chapter, the
concept of life was caught somewhere within the
relation between Creator and creature, with
the concept of life denoting both the concrete
manifestations of living beings, as well as the
abstract principle by which living beings are
living. We are now in a position to take another
step, and consider not just the chapter four
Dark Pantheism

 160 chapter four distinction of Life and the
living, and not just their relation, but the
con- tinuum that runs through each and every
instance of the living, as well as between the
Life-living relation—in other words, the
immanence  that not  only “runs through” but that
constitutes Life and the living. We have seen 
how the mystical theology tradition denies
that any such a concept is pos-sible, since by
defi  nition the divine is that which is beyond
all conception.  Later, the Scholastics would
temper this position and give it a more
rigor-ous formal language. Scholasticism
would suggest that, while the divine is
unknowable in itself, it can be indirectly
known via its  manifestations— thus the Creator
can be known via creatures. In this chapter we
can consider another approach, one that argues
for  a positive conception of the divine in
itself, but which does so through the negation
of its relation to anything outside of it. This
approach we can broadly refer to as that of
“pantheism.” But we should use the word
pantheism with some caution, for, while the
term itself was not in use in the Middle Ages, it
has since come to describe a wide range of
positions that, in one way or another, deny the
absolute transcendence of the di-vine, in
effect equating the divine with the earthly,
the supernatural with the natural—or, as
Spinoza infamously put it, “God or Nature.” 1
Thus, in  considering the concept of life
ontologically, we have moved from a ba- sic
distinction (Life-living), to a fundamental
relation (Creator-creature), to our concern
here, which will be concerned with a type of
continuity (transcendence-immanence). 2
Life can be thought of in terms of that which
changes, becomes, or  fl ows outward in its
generosity. Life can also be thought of in terms
of that  which causes, which forms and shapes, or
which creates and produces. To  these two defi 
nitions of life—as time and as form—we can add a
third.  This is life as that which organizes and
self-organizes, which disperses and is itself
pervasive—life as organizational and
topological, at once om-nipresent and yet
immaterial; this concept of life we can refer to
in terms of spirit. Wha t  is  th e  co n cep t  o f  lif e  w h
en  d e fi  ned in terms of spirit? We can  begin with
the following: life in terms of spirit is the
life beyond all in-stances of the living, while
remaining inseparable from them. We have, on
the one hand, a consideration of life in itself
(“Life”), but this Life is also understood to be
inseparable from the multiple instances of the
liv-ing. Thus when the concept of life is
thought of in terms of spirit, this implies
several meanings of the term: Life-in-itself
(that is, as opposed to any relation to the
living), but also the notion of the
life-beyond-all-living (which presupposes a
relation via negation). The concept of Life is
at once

    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 161 that which is thought in
itself, transcendent to the particular
manifesta- tions in the living, but also that
which courses through them, that cuts across
them, that is them—the “common” that is also all
individuations.  Life, in terms of spirit, is at
once omnipresent and yet in itself, unmani-
fested, “inexistent.” Its relation is through
negation; that which is thought via a negative
relation between Life and the living. When
considered through the ontological (or
onto-theological) lens of spirit, Life is at
once  transcendent—distinguishing itself
from that which is manifested—and  also
immanent—accessible to thought only when
conceived of as insepa-rable from its
manifestations or “expressions.” 4.2 LIFE AS
SPIRIT IN AQUINAS In Scholastic thinking, this
dialectic between transcendence and
imma-nence creates hybrids of nature and
supernature, the earthly and the di-vine. The
concept of “life” is, in this context, a
theological concept before it is a biological
or naturalistic concept. That  life is, is given
testimony by  the many treatises on natural
history, not to mention bestiaries and the
like. Aristotle’s Historia Animalium 
provides us with the blueprint for  this type of
thinking. But the question that persists is
what  life is—what  gives testimony to this
question? A work of metaphysics? A work of
theol-ogy? A work of mysticism? In addition to
the “that” there is the “what”: this is the
life-of-all-life,  the “super-Life”—which in
many instances tends to be equivalent to the
divine itself. Though they differ in their
approaches, both Augustine and the
Pseudo-Dionysius impute a superior,
transcendent Life to the divine. This
superlative Life not only makes possible all
instances of the living, but its absolute
transcendence is such that it comes to be
identifi  ed with  the divine itself. Between
these two extremes, one above the scale of the
human being, the other below the human being,
there are all the manifold instances and types
of life that continue to inform modern
thinking: the life of the cognizing, reasoning
being, the life of the community, the
spiri-tual life of religious ritual, the
political life of the body politic, and so on.
Here we come back to a recurring problem: once
the concept of “life” is de-coupled from its
naturalistic basis, it seems to
all-too-quickly encompass nearly every
sphere of human existence—in many cases
encompassing the nonhuman spheres of nature
and the elements as well. How, then, should we
understand this bifurcation of the concept of
life—at once above and below the scale of the
human? Aquinas provides us with one example,
which we can take as the hege-

 162 chapter four monic statement on the topic.
In the Summa Theologica  Aquinas not only  sets
out the terms for thinking about life in terms of
spirit, but he also  articulates the specifi 
city of this “life” of the divine nature.
Indeed, one of  the surprises that comes out of
the fi  rst part of the Summa is  question 18 
(hereafter q18), simply titled “The Life of
God.” Covering a short four ar-ticles, it forms
part of a longer series of meditations on the
nature of the divine that take up most of the fi 
rst part of the Summa . The q18 is note- worthy
because, if only briefl  y, it raises the
question of an ontology of life  that had been
previously posed by Aristotle. In terms of its
organization,  q18 is situated in an
interesting way. It comes between the initial
ontol-ogy of divine Being and the later
questions (q44–47) on creation and the
relation between Creator and creatures. If the
fi  rst thirteen questions deal  with the Being of
the divine, and if the later questions deal with
creatures  and creation, then q18 stands
squarely in between them, considering the
divine both in itself and in relation to
creaturely life. Before confronting the issue
of the divine life, Aquinas asks how natu- ral
life is attributed—what he takes as the
founding distinction between  the living and
the nonliving. Quoting both Aristotle and the
Pseudo- Dionysius, Aquinas notes that it would
seem to be the case that life is  attributed only
of those things existing in nature, since,
according to Ar-istotle, movement is a key
attribute of all natural things, and since all
natural things participate in movement of some
kind. Following Aristotle, Aquinas notes that
movement can either be movement from an
external source, or movement from an internal
source. Self-movement and other-movement
become the basic conceptual poles around which
Aquinas (via Aristotle) defi  nes life. A q u i n a s
’  s t r a t e g y  i s  t o  e x p a n d  t h e  n o t i o n  o f  l i f e  b e y o n d 
t h e  n a t u - ral  domain. He does this fi  rst by defi 
ning life in a way that attempts to  go beyond mere
tautology, specifi  cally in terms of the
capacity for self-  movement and
self-causation: Whereby it is clear that those
things are properly called living that  move
themselves by some kind of movement, whether it
be a move-ment properly so called, as the act of
an imperfect thing, i.e., of a thing in  p o t e n ti
ali ty ,  i s  call e d  m o v e m e n t ;  o r  m o v e m e n t  in  a  m o r e 
g e n e r al  sense, as when said of an act of a perfect
thing, as understanding and feeling are called
movement. 3 Then, referencing Aristotle,
Aquinas frames this question of self- movement 
within a kind of celestial or cosmic hierarchy:
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    178
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 163 These words of the
Philosopher may be understood either of the fi 
rst  movement, namely, that of the celestial
bodies, or of the movement in  its general sense.
In either way is movement called the life, as it
where, of natural bodies, speaking by a
similitude, and not attributing it to them as
their property. The movement of the heavens is
in the uni-verse of corporeal natures as the
movement of the heart, whereby life is
preserved, is in animals. 4 Note the ambiguity
of this last passage—throughout q18, it
remains un- clear whether both Creator and
creatures are alive in varying degrees of
perfection, or whether Creator and creatures
are both living, but in incom-parable,
equivocal ways. The phrase “speaking by
similitude,” as well as the image of the
“celestial heart” both suggest that Aquinas
makes use of analogical predication here, the
kind that he had previously explicated in the
questions on the divine names and analogy. As if
unsatisfi  ed with this analogical image of the
“cosmic organ”  (what the heart is to the
organism, all natural bodies are to the
heavens), Aquinas then goes on to make an even
more striking analogy: Similarly also every
natural movement in respect to natural things
has  a certain similitude to the operations of
life. Hence, if the whole corpo-real universe
were one animal, so that its movement came from
an in- trinsic moving force , as some in fact have
held, in that case movement  would really be the
life of all natural bodies. 5 The resulting
implication of this passage is that if life is
not only move- ment, but specifi  cally
self-movement, and if this self-movement
occurs in  the celestial as well as earthly
domains, then there is at least the
possibil-ity of thinking “life” in relation to
the divine—though what exactly this relation
is is left somewhat open. Life is, for Aquinas,
defi  ned as being more than the factical
existence  of natural, biological organisms;
it is, following Aristotle, the capacity for
self-movement. It would seem, Aquinas notes,
that life is a process and not a product, an act
and not a thing. Yet Aquinas counters this
notion. His support is a single and enigmatic
phrase from the De Anima : “It seems  that life is
an operation . . . On the contrary, the
Philosopher says, In liv- in g  thin g s  t o  li v e  i s  t
o  b e .” 6 Aquinas has previously suggested that
life  be defi  ned in relation to movement, so much
so that he was willing to  postulate a kind of
“cosmic animal.” This opened the door to
thinking about the divine in terms of life, and
life in terms of movement. But just at

 164 chapter four the moment when he would have to
admit that life is movement (and life  is the
divine), he pulls back and, quoting Aristotle,
asserts a relation be-tween “life” and
“being.” There appears to be a tension here,
between life as dynamic becoming and life as
static being, life as the coming-to-be and
passing-away of nature and life as the
omnipresence of the divine. At this point
Aquinas’ Aristotelianism confronts his
Neoplatonism.  The reason, he explains, why
life is not identical to movement, process,  or
change has to do with the distinction between
essence and existence. Just as we gain
knowledge of the world from our senses, and just
as this knowledge ultimately points to
something beyond what we sense, so does the
notion of life-as-movement ultimately point
beyond the manifestation of movement to . . .
what? To an essence of life? To a divine cause? To
a divine life? Aquinas refuses to take up any of
these possibilities. What he does assert is
that names (in the divine names tradition)
refer to something beyond the sensible and
material, and this is the case with life as well.
The name “life” refers to the sensed
materiality of movement, but more profoundly
it gives us an essence of life—or, we can say,
that by which life is movement: The name
[“life”] is given from a certain external
appearance, namely,  self-movement, yet not
precisely to signify this, but rather a
substance to which self-movement and the
application of itself to any kind of
op-eration, belong naturally . T o live,
accordingly , is nothing else than to exist in
this or that nature. 7 That by which life is
movement is at once something other than life  
(something other than the particular type of
life-that-is-movement—  vegetative,
sensitive, etc.), but it is at the same time
“life itself,” the life  that encompasses the
four types of life given by Aristotle. Aquinas’
move here is complicated. It involves two
gestures. One is  to attempt to explain an
incongruity derived from Aristotle. In the De  
Anima , life is both a life-principle ( psukhe ¯)
as well as a list of the different 
manifestations of that life-principle
(vegetative, sensory, rational). Aristo- tle
never makes clear the relation between, on the
one hand, the principle, and on the other, the
types. Aquinas fi  nds himself caught in this
lacuna.  He attempts to smooth it over using his
analogy of proportion, in which a single term is
predicated of many things, but in different
ways. Recall his privileged example of the
analogy of proportion, drawn from medicine:
“healthy” is predicated in one sense of a
kidney, in another sense of urine produced by
the kidney, in another sense of the whole
organism, and still 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    180
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 165 in another sense of the
practice of medicine. So, here “life” can be
predi- cated of a natural thing that moves, and
also of that by which a natural thing moves.
“Life” can be an actual living thing, such as an
animal, or it can be an essence that conditions
that animal (as well as other living things):
“The Philosopher here takes to live  to mean an
operation of life.  Or it would be better to say
that sensation and intelligence, and the like, 
are sometimes taken for the operations,
sometimes for the existence itself of the
operator.” 8 This may seem to be a rather shaky
cover-up for “the Philosopher,” but  an
important distinction comes out of it: the
distinction between life-as-essence and
life-as-existence. In Thomist terminology,
that by which life is movement is Life or an
essence, whereas the particular
manifestation of life-as-movement is the
living or an existence. The former is
necessary, and without it life cannot be
thought as such; the latter is contingent, and
may or may not exist, irrespective of the
essence. Aquinas has articulated a division,
one that remained implicit in Ar- istotle. But
even if we accept this division between Life and
the living, there still remains the question of
the relation between them, and to what extent
they are both called “life.” This is addressed
in the third article for q18, “Whether Life Is
Properly Attributed to God.” It would seem that
life cannot be attributed to the divine, for God
is eternal, whereas life stops and starts,
lives and dies. God does not have movement as an
attribute or as an effect, even in the sense of
self-movement, for otherwise God and the beast
would be identical. Furthermore—Aquinas
again pulls from the De  Anima —all living things
are said to have an essence, or a principle of
life.  But God does not have an essence, God is
essence, or, more specifi  cally,  the meeting
point of essence and existence. If God has a
principle of life, then there would need to be
something else, something higher by which God
can be said to be living. This last point is
crucial. To say that there is an essence of life
in God,  that God has a life-principle, is
tantamount to suggesting that there is a being
above God, or at least, that there is something
else by which God can be said to exist.
Bizarrely, this is precisely what Aquinas
appears to state: “ I answer that, Life is in the
highest degree properly in God .” 9 The  key
qualifi  er here is the phrase “in the highest
degree.” Aquinas does not  say that life is
univocally predicated of Creator and
creature, God and hu-man  b e ing .  W ha t  h e  d o es  i s 
co n ce i v e  o f  lif e  in  t e rm s  o f  d e gr e es  o f  p e r
-fection. Aquinas again makes use of analogy
(rather than posit univocity or equivocity),
but it is a different type of analogy than in the
previous article. There the analogy of
proportion is used, where a single term is

 166 chapter four predicated in a different
sense of different things: “[S]ince a thing is
said to  live insofar as it operates of itself and
not as moved by another, the more perfectly this
power is found in anything, the more perfect is
the life of that thing.” 10 Aquinas then goes on
to enumerate the stages in the degrees  of
perfection of life. Each is distinguished from
the others, from lowest to highest, by the
proximity of their existence (as actually
living) to their es-sence (as the
form-of-Life): the life that moves itself
through the simple ex-ecution of its nature
(plants), life that moves itself through the
execution of its form (animals), life that
moves itself through an understanding of its
form (humans), and life that is itself
understanding, form, and movement in one
(God). Note that Aquinas follows Aristotle’s
division—up until we reach supernature or the
divine, which is, as it were, the  supernatural
life :  “Wherefore that being whose act of
understanding is its very nature, and which, in
what it naturally possesses, is not determined
by another, must have life in the most perfect
degree. Such is God; and hence in Him
prin-cipally is life.” 11 At this point Aquinas
appears ready to again equate the divine with 
life. Elsewhere in the Summa  (in his proofs for
God’s existence) Aquinas  describes God as that
being in which essence and existence are the
same.  Here, in q18, God is that being in which
Life and the living are the same, the absolute
coincidence of that-which-is-living and
that-by-which-the- living-is-living.
Everything else—all creatures, from humans to
plants— are imperfect manifestations of this
supernatural life, since in them the
distinction between Life and the living is more
evident. A fi nal problem still remains.
Aquinas has given us a defi  nition of life  in line
with Scholastic theology, a defi  nition
according to the essence-  existence
distinction (which becomes isomorphic with
the Life-living dis- tinction). He has also
articulated a relation between life and the
divine, and he has described the relation
between them (according to analogy). And he has
qualifi  ed in what sense life can be predicated
of God (using an- other type of analogy). But if
God is living in the most perfect sense, and if
the difference between creature and Creator is
simply one of degree, then what is to prevent any
creature, for instance, from climbing further
up the ladder and attaining divinity?
Conversely, what is to prevent God from
descending, as it were, into the realm of the
all-too-human, the bestial, or even the
botanical? In short, an onto-theological
problem remains, and that is the problem of
creation, and it is a problem because Aquinas
has described a cause that appears to be both
transcendent (in that the cause remains apart
from its effects) and immanent (in that there is
a gradient of attributes from cause to effect).
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    182
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 167 The fourth and last article
of q18 takes up this problem. Aquinas asks,  are
all living things living “in” God? This is, more
than any of the oth- ers, a rhetorical question,
and it serves as an instance of Aquinas having
his (philosophical) cake and (theologically)
eating it too. In short, Aquinas notes that all
things that are living are in God, simply
because God is the cause of all things. But this
belies a duplicity at the heart of Aquinas’
notion of life. On the one hand the divine being
is transcendent, a cause of life, a principle of
life, a
that-by-which-the-living-is-living. Yet,
on the other hand, the divine being is also
immanent, a gradient of life that is dif-fused
or emanated. While Aquinas’ overarching
project is as much theological as philo-
sophical, his articulation of the Life/living
distinction—here within the  method of
analogy—is nevertheless foundational. It not
only has the effect of recuperating the
ontology of life into onto-theology, but in so
doing it produces a strange, “weird” concept of
supernatural life as its core. Aqui-nas’ text
not only highlights what would otherwise be a
lacuna in Aristo-tle’s thought, but, by
linking this distinction of Life/living to a
question of the divine nature, he also sets up a
provocative debate concerning the concept of
immanence. This debate, which would include
thinkers such as Duns Scotus and Nicholas of
Cusa, would shape the discourse of pan-theism
in the late-Medieval period. 4.3 THE CONCEPT OF
THE DIVINE NATURE The original articulation of
the concept of life as a concept—that of the
split between Life and the living provided by
Aristotle—is formalized in Scholasticism in
terms of the discourse on the divine nature. The
con-cept of the divine nature is a concept that
deals with spirit, the omnipres-ent and yet
unmanifested esse that is the divine. This, in
turn, requires a  dialectic of transcendence
and immanence—the divine or supernatural as
that which is beyond precisely because it is
pervasive and everywhere. We can understand
the phrase “divine nature” here in several
basic  senses—fi  rst, as the nature or essence of
a thing, but also, in a more mod- ern sense, as the
natural world. 12 And this is the sticking point
for many of  the positions dubbed heretical
during the late Middle Ages—for so-called
pantheists such as Amaury of Bene or David of
Dinant, the divine nature was at once an essence
but also “natural.” In Eriugena’s Periphyseon
, the  divine nature, or simply natura , is given
an expanded defi  nition: “Nature,  then, is the
general name, as we said, for all things, for
those that are and those that are not.” 13 As we
will see, there are echoes of Eriugena’s
concept

 168 chapter four in Duns Scotus and Nicholas of
Cusa, before it goes on to obtain a stron- ger
assertion in Spinoza’s notion of a single
substance for all attributes. In short, the
discourse on the divine nature puts at stake the
relation be-tween the “divine” and “nature,”
be it in terms of their transcendence (as in
Aquinas) or their pure immanence (as in the
variants of Medieval pantheism). In Medieval
thought, the terms of the discourse on the
divine nature  are split between transcendence
and immanence. And yet, in the myriad mixtures
that produce Scholastic discourse—from
Patristic theology to Aristotelian natural
philosophy—these two terms are not opposed to
each o t h e r .  I t  i s  i m p o r t a n t  t o  n o t e  t h a t ,  c o n t r a
r y  t o  c o n t e m p o r a r y  “ t h e o r y , ”  there is no confl 
ict of interest between transcendence and
immanence;  more often than not, immanence is
granted a subordinate role within the larger
amb i t of transcen den ce. N ot onl y is th ere m ore
than on e kin d of transcendence or immanence,
but the two concepts are shaped within a
political-theological context, one in which
the maxim of philosophy play-ing handmaiden to
theology was not infrequently contested.
There are two major philosophical concerns
here: one has to do with  causality. The
investigation into causes not only underpins
Scholas- tic metaphysics, but causality and
its attendant terms—production and 
creation—deal more explicitly with the
political and theological impli- cations of
sovereignty and community. The other
philosophical concern is that of order. Nearly
every proof for the existence of God among the
Scholastics contains some form of an argument
from the implicit order in the natural
world—and by extension, among the hierarchy of
creatures in that world. Order is often tied to
hierarchy, which verticalizes order and
intimately ties it to the concerns of causality
. But the metaphysical gulf between Creator and
creature, the divine nature and earthly
nature, also necessitates the recognition of a
more horizontal order, one that is more
distributive. In thinking the concept of
“life” through the divine nature, the
primarily challenge for Scholastic thinkers
is how and in what way to correlate these two
issues of causality and order. This, however,
does not mean that there is a single chorus of
philo- sophical consensus among the
Scholastics; indeed, the fi  ne and subtle dis-
tinctions in Scholastic texts often reveal
major philosophical differences. For
example, through a cursory look at Medieval
thought up to the late twelfth and early
thirteenth centuries—that is, the period of
the intro-duction of Aristotle’s natural
philosophy into the Latin West—one can outline
several variations on the divine nature,
understood as a dialectic between
transcendence and immanence: (i) there is the
long tradition of 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    184
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 169 Neoplatonic thinking,
which has its source in Plotinus and the notion
of  divine emanation, and which also fi  nds
expression in the systematicity  of Arabic
thinkers such as Avicenna; (ii) there is also a
rich tradition of  mysticism that emphasizes
the motif of light and radiation, found in the
Greek and Latin Fathers, but also, later, in the
Arabic-Islamic tradition of
“illuminationist” thinking; (iii) and there
is the thin and fragmented thread of Medieval
pantheism, which fi  nds its most explicit
formulation  in the controversies surrounding
the reading, interpretation, and teaching  of
Aristotle’s natural philosophy in the
thirteenth century. Each of these tendencies
grapples in some way with the role of immanence
in the divine nature—each also stops just short
of a full-blown immanentism, either by
recourse to a fi  rst cause, or by a canalization
of immanence in a single,  outpouring source. T h
e thro ugh - lin e tha t w e will fo ll o w will deal wi
th th e rela ti on be- tween the concepts of life
and immanence. We will consider three forms  of
life-as-immanence: that of Eriugena, whose
work Periphyseon (The Di- vision of Nature ) has
often been read as asserting the equivalence of
the  divine and nature; that of Duns Scotus,
whose arguments for the existence of God reveal
another dimension of his concept of univocity;
and fi  nally  that of the mystical thinker
Nicholas of Cusa, whose major work De Docta 
Ignorantia (On Learned Ignorance ) develops a
more complicated notion of 
life-as-immanence. These three fi  gures of
life-as-immanence will then en- able us to
consider a more contemporary example in Gilles
Deleuze, in his Scholastic-infl  uenced
reading of Spinoza and the concept of
“expression.” If, broadly speaking,
pantheism refers to any system of thought in 
which the divine and nature are indissociable,
then there is a sense in which one can make a claim
for Eriugena, Duns Scotus, and Cusa as
think-ers that engage with the problem of
pantheism. This is not to say that they fully
espouse or unproblematically assert a
pantheist doctrine. It is to sug-gest that,
insofar as pantheism deals with the relation
between the divine and earthly, supernatural
and natural, it must also deal with the concept
of immanence, and the role of immanence in a
philosophical and theo-logical context. Each
of these thinkers deals with two central
questions concerning the concept of
immanence, questions that will guide us in our
readings below. The fi  rst question is whether
the concept of immanence must always  be thought
of in terms of transcendence. Does every
concept of imma-nence imply the transcendence
of that-which-is-immanent? Further, must any
concept of immanence be thought of secondarily
or in a derivative way , from transcendence? How
do Scholastic thinkers deal with the ten-

    </p></div><p>
    
 170 chapter four sions between transcendence
and immanence? To what degree is it pos- sible,
or even desirable, to think of immanence as not
subordinate to tran-scendence, as what
Deleuze calls “pure immanence”? This question
deals with what we can refer to as the
“insubordination of immanence.” A second
question follows from this: what is the
relationship between  immanence and nature? Is
what we call pantheism simply the equiva- lence
of immanence and nature? Does every concept of
natura  in the gen- eral sense imply some notion
of immanence? Conversely, to what degree  does
any concept of immanence imply a notion of
natura , either in terms  of creation and
causality, or in terms of its manifestation or
theophany  (what Deleuze, borrowing from
Nicholas of Cusa, calls “complication” and
“explication”)? Is there a concept of
immanence that is neither re-ducible to natura 
in the narrow sense, nor absolutely above and
beyond   natura ? This question deals with what we
can generally call “supernatural  immanence.”
4.4 IMMANENCE I: ERIUGENA’S PERIPHYSEON The
Periphyseon  is often discussed as an important
nexus between philos- ophy and theology as it
developed in early Medieval Christianity.
Work- ing during the ninth-century
Carolingian renaissance, Eriugena’s
writings incorporate a number of infl  uences
that would be central to the shaping  of later
Medieval intellectual currents. In addition
to the textbooks of the  Trivium  and Quadrivium ,
there is also the infl  uence of Neoplatonism: 
early on, Eriugena wrote a commentary on a fi 
fth-century text by Mar- tianus Capella, the
Wedding of Philology and Mercury , that appears
to  be one of his main Neoplatonic sources.
Eriugena also synthesized infl  u- ences from
both “eastern” and “western” theological
traditions: his work displays a familiarity
with Greek Fathers such as Gregory of Nyssa
(whom he translated), as well as a familiarity
with Latin Fathers such as Augus-tine and
Ambrose. But the single most important infl 
uence on Eriuge- na’s thinking is the
Pseudo-Dionysius. Eriugena completed a
translation of the Pseudo-Dionysius’
Mystical Theology , which became something of  a
textbook for thirteenth-century Scholastic
thinkers. The infl  uence of  the
Pseudo-Dionysius can be seen in Eriugena’s
Periphyseon — book 1, for  instance, devotes
considerable space to the discussion of
affirmative and negative theology, and the
idea of the divine as that which is essentially
inaccessible to thought, and therefore
“nothing” ( nihil ). Wi th this back - ground in
mind, let us take a closer look at the role that
natura  plays in  Eriugena’s work.

  dark pantheism 171 4.4.1 N ATURA  and the
Unthought If Eriugena formalized and
rationalized the mystical theology of the 
Pseudo-Dionysius, he also added a great deal,
in particular a concept of “nature” ( natura )
that was neither the “nature” of natural
philosophy nor  the “nature” of theological
essence. 14 What then is natura  for Eriugena? In 
the Periphyseon , Eriugena has his
interlocutors—a teacher (Nutritor) and  a
student (Alumnus)—discuss the concept of
natura . The Nutritor opens  book 1 with a defi 
nition: As I frequently ponder and, so far as my
talents allow, ever more care- fully
investigate the fact that the fi  rst and
fundamental division of all  things which
either can be grasped by the mind or lie beyond
its grasp is into those that are and those that
are not, there comes to mind as a general term for
them all what in Greek is called fusi~ and in
Latin Natura . 15 Here Eriugena provides two
axes along which the concept of natura  can  be
thought. One axis deals with all that is and all
that is not (we have al- ready encountered this
in an expanded form in chapter two, in
Eriugena’s fi ve modes of being and nonbeing).
This is Eriugena’s primary defi  nition of 
natura , an all-encompassing term, which the
Nutritor defi  nes again: “Na- ture, then, is the
general name, as we said, for all things, for
those that are and those that are not.” 16
Another axis deals with that which can be 
thought and that which cannot be thought. This
follows the same dialec-tic of the fi  rst axis,
but here the emphasis is on the ideation of
natura . The  Alumnus, responding to the
Nutritor, puts it this way: “For nothing at all
can come into our thought that would not fall
under this term [ natura ].” 17  These two axes
both have the dialectical structure of
affirmation and ne-gation (that which is vs.
that which is not; that which can be thought vs.
that which cannot be thought). But the
affirmation and negation in each sense is not
simply an opposition, for “that which is not” is
still affirma-ti v el y consi dered to be a part of
natura . Similarly, the negation of “that  which
cannot be thought” is not simply a privative
negation, or a poten-tiality (e.g., “that
which may possibly be thought in the future”),
but a paradoxical affirmation of the limit of
thought—“that which by defi  ni- tion is
inaccessible to thought,” or simply, that
which is unthought . This  dialectic between
affirmation and negation produces a kind of
oscillation between terms. The various
syntheses of affirmation and negation
actu-ally set things in motion; they
“vertically” govern the modes of being and 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    187
    </p></div><p>
    
 172 chapter four nonbeing, thought and
unthought, but they also distribute natura 
hori- zontally throughout all its
manifestations. In one instance we have an af-
fi rmation of a negation, in which “that which is
not” is affirmed as such;  in another instance we
have a negation of an affirmation, in which the
af-fi rmative inclusion of “that which is not”
in natura  is itself negated, since  “that which
is not” is nothing ( nihil ). Thus, there are
really three elements to Eriugena’s concept of
natura :  an empirical axis of being and
nonbeing, an ideational axis of thought and
unthought, and a dialectical valence of
affirmative negation and nega-tive
affirmation—we can call this third element the
“valence of disper-sion.” They form a basic
diagram (fi  gure 2 ) that structures the
overarch- ing ontology of the Periphyseon .
Already a number of questions arise from  this
diagram of natura . 18 For instance, is every
instance of “that which  is not” also an instance
of “that which cannot be thought”? That is, can
nonbeing be thought, without turning into
being? It would seem that in Eriugena’s
distinction between the negation of being and
the negation of thought is an implication that
“that which is not” can also be “that which can be
thought.” Likewise, does every instance of
“that which cannot be thought” presume a
parallel instance of “that which is not”? That
is, does every unthought imply an inexistent?
Numerous other conundrums can be derived from
Eriugena’s apparently straightforward defi 
nition. But what  is arguably the most important
element in the above diagram is not the two axes
of being or thought, but the dynamics of
affirmation and nega-tion that give coherence
to the two axes. Thus, there are also questions
concerning the role that affirmation and
negation play in producing a dy- Figure 2.  The
two axes of natura  in Eriugena’s Periphyseon .

  dark pantheism 173 namic set of relationships
between being and nonbeing, thought and un-
thought, being and unthought, nonbeing and
thought, and so on. This is the crux of
Eriugena’s concept of natura —that it is not a
static  diagram but one that contains
trajectories, vectors, and dispersions. Dis-
persion in this case is not simply a random
scattering of some attribute or property; in
the concept of natura  it sets natura  into motion
through af- fi rmations and negations, and the
variable syntheses between them. Affir-
mations and negations are always coupled in
natura , and, in many cases,  synthesized in
paradoxical formulations—e.g., the divine as
both pure af-fi rmation and pure negation, the
notion of the divine as the “darkness of 
super-essential light,” and so on. Arguably,
Eriugena’s notion of natura  is an  indelibly
dispersional notion, asserting at once the
transcendence of the di-vine nature, while
also implying its immanence along the two axes,
them-selves conditioned by the processual
nature of affirmation and negation. Eriugena
enframes this entire diagram (of
being/nonbeing, of thought/ unthought, of
affirmation/negation) within the concept of
natura . This is,  as the Nutritor notes, at once a
classical, even presocratic notion of
“na-ture” (as phusis ), but also a theological
notion, synthesizing as it does  the notion of
essence with a monistic view of “the One.” If
everything— including that which is not—is
encompassed within natura , then how can  one
account for the different senses of “nature,”
from the narrow notion  of natural philosophy,
to natural theology, to the mystical notion of
divine nature? There appears to be a gulf, then,
between the overarching princi-ple of natura ,
and the manifold affirmations and negations
that constitute  “nature” in the other senses,
and which are contained within the single,
monistic natura . This is, certainly, a problem
of the One and the Many— but more importantly, it
is a problem of the relations, dynamics, and
above all the dispersions between the One and
the Many, between natura  and  “nature” in the
narrow sense. It is in order to address this
question that Eriugena turns to what is  perhaps
his most well-known doctrine, the four basic
divisions of natura .  Just following his defi 
nition, the Nutritor provides a brief outline
of the divisions of natura : It is m y opinion that
the division of Nature by means of four differ -
ences results in four species, (being divided)
fi  rst into that which cre- ates and is not
created, secondly into that which is created
and also creates, thirdly into that which is
created and does not create, while the fourth
neither creates nor is created. 19

    </p></div><p>
    
 174 chapter four For the sake of clarity, we can
simply list the four divisions as follows: •
That which creates & is not created
(God/Universal Nature) • That which creates &
is created (Intellect/Ideas) • That which does
not create & is created (nature, creatures) •
That which does not create & is not created
(God/Universal  Nature) As the Nutritor goes on
to explain, the four divisions of natura  form a 
single, unifi  ed system, with each division
related to the other through  the “dispersive”
dynamics of affirmation and negation,
creation and un- creation. The fi  rst
division—that which creates and is not
created—is the  divine nature in itself. Only
God is that which is the uncreated Creator.  The
second division—that which creates and is
created—is what are vari-ously called the
Intelligences, Ideas, or Primordial Causes.
Here Eriugena’s Neoplatonic infl  uence shows
most clearly, for the Ideas are neither the di-
vine in itself, nor the multiple instances of
creatures in the world; they  are precisely the
mediators between Creator and creatures,
existing in a perfected state. They are, in a
sense, the models of creatures. The third 
division—that which is created and does not
create—is the world of crea- tures and “nature”
in the narrow sense. Eriugena, following a
common theological trend, makes a distinction
between “creation” and mere “mak-ing” or
“production,” the latter the activity of
certain creatures such as human beings.
Finally, there is the fourth division—that
which does not create and is not created—which
is also, like the fi  rst division, the divine 
nature in itself. Thus the four divisions form a
circle, the fi  nal returning  to the fi  rst, all
affirmation culminating in a negation, which
itself circles  back to a superlative
affirmation. As we’ve noted, Eriugena’s
concept of natura  deals not only with cre- ation
and the relation between Creator and creature,
but with the dis-persions of natura  through a
dialectics of affirmation-negation. The four 
divisions of natura  a r e  i n t e r r e l a t e d  i n  t h i s  w a

[divisions] there are two pairs of opposites.
For the third is the opposite of the fi  rst, the
fourth of the second; but the fourth is  classed
among the impossibles, for it is of its essence
that it cannot be.” 20  Let us keep with our wobbly
diagram and present the four divisions of
natura  as in fi  gure 3. Following the Nutritor,
we can see that the fi  rst and  third are inversely
paired according to the dialectic in creating
and being created. The same can be said for the
second and fourth divisions. From another
perspective, the fi  rst and second divisions
can be paired together

    190
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 175 as active principles, while
the third and fourth can be paired together as 
passive principles. Finally, the fi  rst and
fourth divisions are identical, in  that they
both defi  ne the divine nature in itself, while
the second and third  divisions are identical,
in that they both describe the domain of
creation. Everything, however, returns to the
single principle of natura , wherein  Creator
and creature become indistinct: “So the
universe, comprising God  and creature, which
was fi  rst divided as it were into four forms, is
reduced  again to an indivisible One, being
Principle as well as Cause and End.” 21 In  a
rather tidy fashion, the four divisions of
natura  are in this way unifi  ed:  four becomes two
(God and creation), and two becomes one ( natura
). The concept of natura  in  Eri u g e na  i s  c l ear l y  m
o r e  than  “ na tur e ”  in   the narrow sense of natural
philosophy. But it is also not simply the di-
vine “nature” in an absolutely transcendent
sense. The concept of natura   is not a
stand-alone concept, but one that, as the
Periphyseon  states, must  be thought of in terms
of its divisions and dispersions. This
dialectic of splitting-apart and re-unifying
has the effect of bifurcating the concept of
natura  into that which is manifested (the
second and third divisions) and  that which is
not (the fi  rst and last divisions). Natura  is
both that which  has a concrete, manifested, and
created reality (the creation of the Ideas and
the world), but also that which has an abstract,
unmanifested, and uncreated reality (the
divine as alpha and omega, as “universal
nature”). Paradoxically, natura  is at once
something (creatures, the natural world)  and
nothing (the divine as a negation that is not a
privative negation, but a superlative one).
And it is here that the question of life comes
into focus. As we’ve noted  Figure 3.  The
creation and uncreation of natura  in
Eriugena’s Periphyseon .

 176 chapter four previously, there are several
notions of life at work in Medieval onto- 
theology: the life of the natural world (the
biologistic sense), the life of  the divine
nature (the theological sense), and the life of
their relation (the ontological sense).
Eriugena does, certainly, account for the fi 
rst sense of  naturalistic “life,” but much of
the Periphyseon  is are concerned with the 
latter two types of life—the superlative life
of the divine nature in itself, and the
relational, dynamic life of Creator and
creature. These latter two notions of life—the
fi  rst defi  ned in terms of immaterial spirit,
the second  in terms of an equally immaterial
relation—come together in Eriugena’s
dispersional notion of the “life” of the
divine: For the whole river fi  rst fl  ows forth
from its source, and through its  channel the
water which fi  rst wells up in the source
continues to fl  ow  always without any break to
whatever distance it extends. So the Di- vine
Goodness and Essence . . . fi  rst fl  o w  d o wn  in t o  th
e  p rim o r di al   causes . . . fl  owing forth
continuously through the higher to the lower; 
and return back again to their source.22 In
Neoplatonic fashion, Eriugena borrows the
notions of emanation, out- pouring, and fl  ux
not as the divine in itself, and not as the
manifold crea- tures that fl  ow out from the
divine source, but as the continuum or disper-
sion that runs through them, the life to come
that is at once temporally  placed in the
afterlife as well as spatially distributed
throughout all of na- tura.23 This continuum
stretches between the creaturely life and the
divine  life, but it is not simply “life” in terms
of the dynamics of sovereign cre-ation.
Eriugena does assimilate the Neoplatonic
notion of a divine source and emanation, but he
also situates it within what is a unique
framework of affirmation and negation,
division and unicity, esse and nihil . Neither
is  this life that of creatures or creation.
Eriugena devotes considerable time to the life
of creatures and creation—in book 3 he
articulates an ascending order of creation,
from natural bodies such as rocks
(subsistence), to plants (subsistence and
life), to animals (with senses), to rational
animals, and the primordial causes (located in
the spiritual creatures). 24 However, what  is
of primary philosophical interest is the way in
which he articulates a universal life that runs
through them, establishing a continuity
within natura  while also establishing
differentiations. 25 Thus, in each instance  in
which Eriugena asserts either the creaturely
life or the divine life in it-self, he also
asserts the interrelational continuum or
dispersion that runs through them.

  dark pantheism 177 4.4.2 Universal Life This
tension is best demonstrated by a brief
discussion in book 3 around  the concept of
universal life. Here the Nutritor engages in a
bit of thinking aloud. The Nutritor asks why,
amid all the scriptural talk of creation and
natura , there is no mention of “life”:
“Throughout the four days of the cre- ation of
natures that have already been discussed we
read of no mention of the soul ( animae ) either
simply or absolutely or with the qualifi  cation
‘liv- ing’ ( uiuentis ), and it is not
inappropriate to ask why.” 26 The Nutritor
offers  one, provisional response. Since
neither life nor ensoulment is mentioned in the
Hexameron, the natural world, which was
created during this time, is therefore neither
alive nor ensouled. For there are those who say
that the elements of this world, I mean the 
heaven with its stars, and the ether with its
planets, the air with its clouds and breaths of
wind and lightnings and other disturbances,
the water also and its fl  owing motion, likewise
the earth with all its plants  and trees, are not
only without soul ( anima ) but also without any
kind  of life ( uitae ) at all. 27 But this is too
literal a response, for, as the Nutritor notes,
refl  ection on  life is a central part of
classical thought: “Plato, the greatest of the
phi- losophers, and his sectaries not only
affirm a general life of the world (generalem
mundi uitam ), but also declare that there is no
form attached  to bodies nor any body that is
deprived of life; and that life, whether
gen-eral or special, they confi  dently dare to
call soul ( animam ).” As the Nu- tritor notes,
scripture agrees with this, “affirming that
plants and trees and all things that grow out of
the earth are alive.” Thus, in contrast to the fi 
rst, literal response (that “life” is not
mentioned in the Hexameron),  the Nutritor
offers a second, alternative response by way of
a Platonic-Neoplatonic “soul.” But even this
just touches the surface for the Nutritor, who
then goes  on to offer a third response, again by
way of classical thought—this time by way of a
Neoplatonic fi  ltering of Aristotle: Nor does
the nature of things permi t i t to be otherwise.
For if there  is no matter which without form
produces body, and no form subsists without its
proper substance, and no substance can be
without the vital motion ( uitali motu ) which
contains it and causes its subsistence—for

 178 chapter four everything which is naturally
moved receives the source of its motion  fr o m  s o m
e  lif e— ,  i t  n eces saril y  f o ll o w s  tha t  e v e ry  c r ea
tur e  is  e i th e r  Life-through-itself ( se ipsam
uita ) or participates in life and is some- how
alive, whether the vital motion is clearly
apparent in it or is not apparent but the
sensible species itself shows that it is
hiddenly gov-erned [through] life. 28 Thus for
the Nutritor, this is confi  rmed by the concepts
of (Neoplatonic- Aristotelian) metaphysics.
There is no body without matter and form, no  form
without substance, and no substance without
the vital motion of en-soulment. All creation
is either self-ensouled or ensouled through
another source than itself. Given this
framework, the Nutritor is led into some
interesting terri- tory. If the fundamental
principle of life is not limited to the
individual organism or to the species of living
being to which the organism belongs, then it
would seem that a meta-level concept of life
would be necessary, a concept of life beyond
either organism or species. It is here that the
Nutri-tor posits the existence of a universal
life : For as there is no body which is not
contained within its proper spe- cies, so there
is no species which is not controlled by the
power of some life ( uitae ). Therefore, if all
bodies which are naturally constituted are 
governed by some species of life ( specie uitae
), and every species seeks  its own genus while
every genus takes its origin from universal
sub-stance, it must be that every species of
life which contains the numer-ousness of the
various bodies returns to a universal life (
generalissi- mam quandam uitam ), by
participation in which it is a species. 29 The
Aristotelian outlook leads to a hierarchy of
life forms, in terms of  body-species-life,
with the middle term, species, serving as an
abstract, mediating set-concept. But this
then requires that one conceive of a higher
life-concept beyond the individuated
organism or body, and beyond the set or category
concept of species—but without simply
relinquishing the con-cept of life so that it is
equivalent to God or Being. Interestingly,
Eriugena has the Nutritor pursue a line of
thought con- cerning life in such a way that the
concept resists being sublimated into a
discussion of metaphysics or the divine
nature. It is for this reason that t h e  N u t r i t o r  c
o m e s  u p  w i t h  t h e  s t r i k i n g  p h r a s e  “ u n i v e r s a l  l i f
e . ”  T h i s  universal life is not itself a type or
instance or life—it is something like
meta-life, a life-beyond-life, which
ontologically structures both the life of 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    194
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 179 species and organisms. But
this then leads to the question of how this uni-
versal life—which the Nutritor links to the
Neoplatonic soul—is different from the divine
nature itself. Now, this universal life (
generalissima uita ) is called by the natu- ral
philosophers the Universal Soul (
uniuersalissima anima ) which  through its
species controls the totality which is
contained within the  orbit of the heavenly
sphere, while those who contemplate the Divine
Sophia call i t th e comm on life ( commumem uitam
), which, while it  participates in that one Life
which is substantial in itself and is the
fountain and creator of all life, by its
division into things visible and in vis i b l e  dis
tri b u t es  li v es  in  a cco r dan ce  wi th  th e  Di vin e  Or
dinan ce ,  as this Sun which is known to the senses
pours forth its rays on all around. 30 It is easy
to see the corner into which the Nutritor has
painted himself.  On the one hand the existence
of natura  in the sense of the created, nat- ural
world is testimony to the existence of a
life-beyond-life, a life not limited to
individual organisms or species categories.
But then, theologi-cally speaking, one would
also have to distinguish this “universal life”
from the divine nature itself, otherwise there
would remain little to separate the
supernatural from the natural, the divine from
the bestial. Philosophically speaking, the
challenge is to explain how a metaphysi-cal
principle concerning life is to be
distinguished from the structure of natural
theology. Either one preserves the
distinction—and thus the tran-scendental 
hierarchy—or else one admits the equivalence,
in a generalized   pantheism—and thus the
absence of any conceptual grounding at all. How 
can life be thought as such without resorting to
a structure of thought that is basically
theophanic? The Nutritor attempts to nuance
this through a series of conceptual  modifi 
cations. The fi  rst is a modifi  cation from the
Neoplatonic fi  gure of  the sun (radiation,
emanation, from a divine source) that is
adapted to the quasi-Aristotelian fi  gure of na
ture an d animism. As th e N u tri tor n otes ,  “[T]he
way in which life reaches all things is not the
same as that in which the rays of the Sun do; for
these do not penetrate all things . . . But no
crea-ture, whether sensible or intelligible,
can be without life ( uitae ).” 31 So, at  some
level, the ontological concept of life must be
distinguished from the Neoplatonic,
emanative “soul.” The second modifi  cation is a
shift from life as the source of growth, 
development, and generosity to life as a
continuum that is also involved 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

 180 chapter four in decay, decomposition, and
negation. Here the exemplar is not the living 
organism but the corpse, which is, for the
Nutritor, not devoid of life but still fi  lled
with it—that is, living though a generosity or
givenness of decay  and decomposition. This
process returns the discrete to the
continuous,  and thus to an immanence or Life.
This is what the Nutritor provocatively calls
the “unrelinquished corpse”: For even the
bodies which appear to our senses as dead are not
entirely  abandoned by life ( uita relinquuntur
). For just as their composition and  formation
were accomplished by the administration of
their proper life, so also is their dissolution
( solutio ) and unforming ( informitas )  and
return ( reditus ) into the things from which
they originated subject  to the obedience of the
same. 32 The third modifi  cation the Nutritor
makes is to move from life as a prin- ciple above
and beyond the living to life as a process within
the living (e.g.,  life as “in” the decaying
body). Here he makes use of a fi  gure well-known 
within Pauline discourse—the botanical fi 
gure of the seed as emblematic  of growth and
development. But the Nutritor is keen to link
this fi  gure of  growth with the “necrological”
processes of decay and decomposition al- luded
to earlier: Seeds which are committed to the
earth will not put on life again un- less they fi 
rst die; and their death is the separation of
matter and form;  and that life which quickens
the seminal force and through the seminal force
does not abandon them until they are resolved
into dissolution, but ever cleaves to them, is
indeed that life which dissolves them . . . For
where would that life be at the time of the body’s
dissolution but in the body that is undergoing
dissolution? 33 In these modifi  cations the
Nutritor attempts to at once assert the imma-
nence between the divine and natura , while at
the same time preserving  their metaphysical
hierarchy. Life is not simply identical with
Neoplatonic  theophany or emanation from a
divine Source, for there is not simply a life of
the individuated organism and a life of the
species, but a “universal life” that
ontologically grounds the other two. Life is
also defi  ned in terms  of dynamical processes,
processes that include growth and decay,
devel-opment and decomposition. Both of these
imply a continuum: a vertical continuum of life
along organism-species-universal life, and a
horizontal continuum along which life
operates as biological as well as
necrological.

  dark pantheism 181 Granted, we are using modern
terms to describe the Nutritor’s rumi- nations
on what is still an onto-theological concept of
life. But in reart- iculating life as a
continuum, the Nutritor raises the
possibility that it is precisely this
continuum that both relates and separates the
divine and natura , the supernatural and
natural. At its limit, we might ask whether 
Eriugena’s concept of nihil  comes to describe
this continuum of universal  life. Is nihil 
precisely that which provides the principle of
immanence be- tween God and Nature? 4.4.3 Four
Statements on Pantheism Answering this
question requires that we revisit the theme of
pantheism. In his discussion of the divine
nature, Eriugena synthesizes the poetics of
mystical theology with the logic of classical
and Neoplatonic thought, and it is here that the
works of the Pseudo-Dionysius become
important. It is this concept of natura  that
Eriugena sets side by side with the Diony- sian
concept of nothing ( nihil ). We have seen how the
question of life in  Eriugena’s Periphyseon  is
stratifi  ed along three lines: the life of
nature in  the narrow sense of creatures and the
natural world, the life of the divine  nature
considered in itself, and fi  nally the life of
the divisions, relations,  and dispersions
between the fi  rst and second kinds of life. This
third kind  of life is what we have referred to as
the “dispersional nature.” It is at once
subordinate to the fi  rst two, insofar as it
constitutes the relations between  primary
entities; but in a way it is also superlative to
them, since Eriuge-na’s notion of natura  as
nihil —as “divine negation” or the
“super-essential  nothing”—raises this
property of dispersion to the level of an
ontological principle. The question, then, is
whether the Periphyseon  does indeed fore-
ground this dispersional nature, or whether it
remains secondary and sub-servient to the
divisions within natura . If the Periphyseon 
can be read— albeit in a radicalized way—as
ontologically foregrounding this third type
of life or dispersional nature, then we are led
to consider the concept of life in relation to
Eriugena’s two central terms: natura  and nihil
. The im- plications in Eriugena’s Periphyseon 
are, one must admit, intriguing: if the  divine
is essentially “nothing” in an absolute and
superlative sense, and if “nature” broadly
speaking derives from the divine, then to what
extent should one think of natura  as nihil ? In
other words, to what extent does  the continuum
between the divine-as-nothing and
nature-as-nothing re-veal a concept of
immanence that is common to them both? However,
an inquiry into the immanence-in-itself of
natura  is possi- ble, for Eriugena, only
through the negative or apophatic way.
Immanence

    197
    </p></div><p>
    
 182 chapter four cannot be a thing since it would
then cease to be immanence; but neither  can it be
everything since the term would lose all
meaning. In this way, imman en ce m us t be th o ugh t
in rela ti on to transcen den ce—be i t imma -nence
as subordinate to transcendence, or
immanence-in-itself. Eriugena’s approach in
the Periphyseon , particularly in books 1 and 2,
is to offer a  number of variations on a theme,
with the Nutritor often repeating and  revising
arguments at different moments in the
dialogue. While there is no single, formalized
proof for the divisions of natura  in the
Periphyseon ,  the arguments can be segmented
into four stages. First statement of the
transcendental circle . God is the beginning, 
middle, and end of all things: that from which
all things originate, that in which all things
participate, and that to which all things
return. God is self-organizing, at once
uncreated and yet, in the act of creating,
creating God’s self. 34 “And while it is eternal
it does not cease to be made, and made  it does not
cease to be eternal, and out of itself it makes
itself, for it does not require some other
matter which is not itself in which to make
itself.” 35  Thus creation is at once divine and
eternal (since God is created in its
cre-ation), and yet earthly and temporal
(since creation is created by God): There is no
one of those who devoutly believe and
understand the truth  who would not
persistently and without any hesitation
declare that the creative Cause of the whole
universe is beyond nature and beyond being and
beyond life and wisdom and power and beyond all
things which are said and understood and
perceived by any sense. 36 Second statement of
dispersional immanence . Despite the
necessity  of the transcendental circle, God
and creatures form “an indivisible One,  being
Principle as well as Cause and End.”37 God is
unity, “since all things  are from Him and
through Him and in Him and for Him.”38 However,
for  Eriugena it is unclear if natura  is also a
unity in the same way. Since God  is unity,
nothing can be coeternal or coexistent with
God. Thus all that i s  n o t -G o d  m u s t  b e  in  s o m e  s e n s
e  r e l a t e d  t o  G o d .  T h u s  all  th a t  i s  c r e -ation
(not-God in the absolute sense) is actually God
(in the contingent, theophanic sense): And do
not be surprised if you fi  nd something said in
this book about  the return of the creatures to
their Beginning and End. For the pro- cession of
the creatures and the return of the same are so
intimately associated in the reason which
considers them that they appear to be 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    198
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 183 inseparable the one from the
other, and it is impossible for anyone to  give
any worthy and valid account of either by itself
without introduc-ing the other, that is to say,
of the procession without the return and
collection and vice versa. 39 Third statement
of antinomial syntheses . God is at once within
natura   and yet remains above it, at once
immanent in God’s creations and yet re- maining
transcendentally above creation.40 “But if
the creature [ is ] from  God, God will be the
cause, but the creature the effect. But if an
effect is nothing else but a made cause, it
follows that God the Cause is made in His
effects.” 41 God is therefore unity in
diversity, the One in the many: It follows that
we ought not to understand God and the creature
as two  things distinct from one another, but as
one and the same. For both the creature, by
subsisting is in God; and God, by manifesting
Himself, in a marvelous and ineffable manner
creates Himself in the creature, the invisible
making Himself visible and the
incomprehensible compre-hensible and the
hidden revealed and the unknown known. 42
Fourth statement of the problematic of
pantheism . It is from the third  to this fourth
statement that the question of pantheism
arises. “For the  procession of the creatures
and the return of the same are so intimately
associated in the reason which considers them
that they appear to be in-separable the one from
the other.” 43 “So when we hear that God makes all 
things we ought to understand nothing else than
that God is in all things, and He alone is
everything which in the things that are is truly
said to be.” 44 And here we arrive at a series of
questions that, while not directly  posed by
Eriugena, are at least evoked by a number of
central passages in the Periphyseon . Q 1: Is God
subsumed within Nature? Is Nature sub- sumed
within God? Q2: Is God-in-itself identical
with God-in-others? That  is, is the divine
nature identical with manifestation or
theophany? Q3: Is  God-as-absolute (that is, as
nihil ) identical with God-as-manifestation
(as  theophany)? And fi  nally, Q4: Are God and
Nature identical? God is the Maker of all things
and is made in all things; and when  He is looked
for above all things He is found in no
essence—for as yet there is no essence—but when
He is understood in all things nothing in them
subsists but Himself alone; and ‘neither is He
this,’ as he says, ‘but not that,’ but He is all.

 184 chapter four “Life” never means one thing
for Eriugena; as with many concepts in the 
Periphyseon , one must pay attention to the
dialectics of affirmation and  n ega ti on. I t is
for this reason tha t con tem porary Eri ugena sch
o lars hav e  suggested that the Periphyseon  be
understood not just as a negative theol- ogy in
the Dionysian sense, but also as a negative
ontology. If a negative  theology stops at the
point of super-essential negation—God is
inacces-sible and thus all knowledge can only
be of a negative type—a negative ontology would
follow this thought to its antinomial
conclusion. The im-p li ca ti o n  i s  tha t  th e  co n

particular form of pantheism often attributed
to Eriugena’s philosophy. 4.5 IMMANENCE II:
DUNS SCOTUS’ REPORTATIO  IA The tension between
transcendence and immanence in Eriugena’s
Periph- yseon  is extended further when we
consider the work of Duns Scotus. In  the
previous chapter, we saw how Scotus’ central
concept of univocity po-sitioned him against
both the position of analogy and the position of
equiv-ocity. For Scotus, the concept of
univocity is a relational concept; that is, it
deals primarily with the relationship between
Creator and creature. To ar-gue that the
relationship between Creator and creature is
univocal would be to argue for an ontological
continuity between them—in spite of, or
perhaps because of—the relation of cause and
effect between them. The problem encountered
by Scholastic thinkers was how to balance  the
identity and difference between Creator and
creature. On the one hand, the relation of
causality between Creator and creature (the
latter defi ned precisely as that which is
created) would seem to imply a funda- mental,
essential difference between them—the
Creator not only creates the creature, but in so
doing remains outside the creature. On the
other hand, a central aspect of the concept of
causality, as it was understood by the
Scholastics, was the continuity between
Creator and creature, the former in some way
subsisting in the latter through the act of
creation itself. There were, of course,
variations on how this occurs, such as in the
Neoplatonic notion of intermediary
Intelligences, but the basic idea of the
Creator “in” the creature remains. Hence the
dilemma—how can one en-tity A cause another
entity B while at the same time remaining
insepa- rable and even coextensive with it?
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    200
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 185 4.5.1 Univocal Immanence In
the context of Medieval philosophy, either of
the options of univocity  or equivocity points
to a dilemma. To claim absolute equivocity
would be tantamount to either agnosticism, or
the most radical form of “ darkness mysticism.”
To claim absolute univocity would effectively
fl  atten Creator  and creature into a single
continuum, in which God and Nature are
identi-cal. Historically, no such positions
were held, for even though contempo-rary
thinkers such as Deleuze choose to radicalize
this pantheistic com-ponent in Scotus,
Scotus’ writings themselves often tend
towards a more balanced, tempered univocity .
But the suggestion is still there, and it
re-mains relevant for the kinds of questions it
raises concerning the concepts of Life and the
living. In the reading of Scotus adopted here,
we will inten-tionally push the positions of
univocity and equivocity to their extremes, in
order to foreground the aporias inherent in the
Scholastic discussion on the divine nature. We
should also note a terminological dilemma as
well. If one posits  a univocal relation between
Creator and creature, and if this proposition
means that there is something “common” to them
both, something that runs through them, then is
this not an argument for a relation of
imma-nence as well? What, then, is the
difference between the concept of uni-vocity
and that of immanence? While Scotus does favor
the term univoc-ity (univocum , univocationis
), he rarely mentions the term immanence, or 
speaks of the divine in terms of immanence.
Certainly, part of the reason for this is
historical, as the terminology of the twelfth-
and thirteenth- century  Scholastics centered
around the triad of
univocity-equivocity-analogy. At the same
time, however, Aquinas will often speak of the
divine in terms of transcendence, and numerous
Neoplatonic thinkers employ the language of
immanence to describe the diffusion of the
divine into its theophanies. So, one question
is whether Scotus’ concept of univocity—which
de- scribes a relation between Creator and
creature—also evokes a concept of immanence.
The concept of univocity can be mapped onto the
concept of immanence, of course, but only
partially so. For example, the position of
analogy would argue for a fundamental
difference between Creator and creature, such
that one would say that what good acts or the
state of being alive is to the creature, the Good
itself or Life itself is to the Creator. This
presupposes a limit to the natural knowledge of
the divine, a limit that is, for Aquinas,
negotiated through analogy (not A in itself but
a , which is  “like-A ”). The divine remains not
just inaccessible, but also transcendent, 
both in terms of natural knowledge and in terms
of causality.
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    201
    </p></div><p>
    
 186 chapter four It is interesting to note that
the position of equivocity implies some- thing
similar. Equivocity also implies a basic
inaccessibility with regard  to the divine, but
it pushes this further , making this
inaccessibility the ground for the relation
between Creator and creature itself. The
problem, of course, with equivocity is that it
cannot account for the relation be-tween
Creator and creature, other than to posit that
it exists. The posi-tions of analogy and
equivocity are inversely related on the issue
of tran-scendence: with analogy, one can
account for the relation between Creator and
creature, but not the Creator in itself, while
with equivocity, one can account for the
Creator in itself (if only to assert its
absolute difference), but not the relation
between Creator and creature. With analogy,
one can state that God is, but not what  God is,
while for equivocity, one can state  what  God is
(even if God is that which is absolutely other),
but not that   God is (since God is absolutely
inaccessible). One could argue that the
positions of analogy and equivocity priori-
tize the divine attribute of
transcendence—the Creator remains
absolutely  separate from the creature (its
absolute difference in terms of essence), and
the Creator remains causally prior to the
creature (its absolute difference in terms of
existence). Immanence comes into play only
insofar as some account must be made of the
relationality between Creator and creature,
of the relation that itself constitutes the
process of creation. Immanence would then
derive from an ontologically prior
transcendental relation: fi  rst  you have the
transcendental relation between Creator and
creature, based on causality, then you have the
dispersion of the former—in the form of
spirit—throughout the latter, while never
being totally confused with it such that they
would be identical. This is, more or less, the
position found in Aquinas. If this can be
accepted, then it would seem that the position
of Sco- tist univocity, privileging as it does
the continuity between Creator and creature,
would be paired with immanence. Not only that,
but Scotist uni-vocity would invert the
hierarchy (or fl  atten it), instead arguing for
the  primacy of immanence in itself. In this
radicalized position, immanence would not be
derived from transcendence, but the inverse:
the ontological priority of immanence would
result only secondarily in the coalescence of
discrete hierarchies surrounding causation.
But then the question is whether the immanence
in this “univocal immanence” is the same as the
derivative, secondary immanence in the former
case (an “analogical imm an e n c e ”  an d  an  “ e q ui v o
c al  imm an e n c e ” ) .  C o n t e m p o r ary  r ea d e r s  o f 
Scotus such as Deleuze tend to emphasize the
uniqueness of univocal im-manence as
diametrically opposed to analogical or
equivocal immanence:
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 187 Because I say: being is
univocal, this means: there is no categorical 
difference between the assumed senses of the
word “being” and being is said in one and the same
sense of everything which is. In a certain
manner this means that the tick is God; there is
no difference of cate-gory, there is no
difference of substa nce, there is no
difference of form.  It becomes a mad thought. 46
Again, one can read Scotus in this radicalized
way, and there is a great deal  of reason to do so,
especially if one places him in relation to
other, “imma-nentist” thinkers such as
Eriugena before him, and Spinoza after him. But
the difficulty in pinning a single position to a
thinker like Scotus is that, in his writings,
further and further distinctions are always
made, distinc-tions that nearly always have
the effect of complexifying his statements and
his concepts. While Scotus will assert quite
strongly the univocity of Creator and
creature, as well as the possibility of a
natural knowledge of the divine, he will also
make the distinction between that which is
meta-physically  univocal and yet physically 
analogical. 47 Thus, that which is  in-itself
may be univocal, but in-another, or in relation
to others, it may be analogical (or, for that
matter, equivocal). There are, then, several
kinds of immanence possible with regard to 
Scotus’ philosophy. One kind of immanence
would pertain to the rela-tion between Creator
and creature. This is based, in part, on a
relation of causality, and the distinction
between secondary and tertiary causes (of
abstract Intelligences or of creatures), and
primary or fi  rst causes (of the  Creator). But
there are also two other kinds of immanence to
consider: the immanence that pertains to the
Creator-in-itself (or the divine-in-itself,
or Life-in-itself), and the kind of immanence
that would pertain to the relation between one
creature and another creature. The fi  rst—the 
Creator-in-itself, the divine nature—is defi 
ned as that which is absolutely  “above”—above
nature, above natural knowledge, and so on. The
sec-ond—the creature-creature relation—is
conversely defi  ned as that which  is 
“below”—below the divine, below revelation,
and so on. But what if  the fi  rst (supernature) is
coextensive with the second (nature)? As we saw 
in the last chapter, this is a distinction that
both Aquinas and Henry of  Ghent make—but they do
so in order to conserve the hierarchy between 
Creator and creature, supernature and nature.
Let us pose a question: what if there is a concept
of immanence that presumes the distinction
between the divine nature and nature, but only
in order to assert the continuity  between them ?
Perhaps this describes Scotus’ position
regarding “univocal imma-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    203
    </p></div><p>
    
 188 chapter four nence.” Not only is immanence
the derivative form of the relation between 
Creator and creature, but it may also deal with
these two other instances: the
Creator-in-itself (the divine nature), and
the relationality between any two creatures
(and is this not one description of what natural
philosophy is for the Scholastics?). In order
for Scotus to make an argument for the primacy of
immanence, or for a univocal immanence, it
seems that two propositions would have to be
made: fi  rst, Scotus would have to suggest  that
the divine nature is in itself immanent (while
also transcendent in relation to non-divine
nature), and, second, that the relation
between any two creatures is an immanent
relation. But do Scotus’ writings bear this
out, and can one read him—or creatively misread
him—as making such claims? 4.5.2 Actual
Infinity T o answer this question, we should
remind ourselves that Scotus’ major writings
are not solely concerned with the debate on the
creature. More well-known are his proofs for
the existence of God, which are found, with a
degree of consistency, throughout Scotus’
early lectures at the University of Oxford and
his later lectures at the University of Paris.
Scotus provided several versions of this
proof, and there is some confusion as to the
exact relation of each version to the others,
which came fi  rst, and which was  deemed
authoritative by Scotus himself. 48 For
instance, scholars estimate  that there are at
least four variations of Scotus’ proofs for the
existence of  God: the original lectures (
lectura ) given at Oxford, an initial
collection of  the Oxford lectures ( ordinatio
), the collection of the lectures at Paris,
writ- ten down by someone other than Scotus (
reportatio ), and a possible fi  nal  collection
of the Oxford lectures (a second ordinatio ).
Matters are made  more confusing by the fact that
there does not exist a defi  nitive edition of  the
Oxford works.49 Thus, while the problem of the
transcendence and the  immanence of the divine
nature remained a central concern for Scotus,
the themes and variations on the topic seem to
imply that Scotus may have never been totally
satisfi  ed with a single, defi  nitive statement
on the  subject. For our purposes here, we want to
focus on the way in which Sco-tus develops a
concept of “univocal immanence”—and how he
structures the pantheistic implications of
this univocal immanence with the theo-logical
and philosophical demands of divine
transcendence and ontologi-cal
prioritization. The structure of Scotus’
argument for the existence of God repeats  with a
great deal of consistency between the Oxford
Ordinatio  and the 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    204
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 189 Parisian Reportata . In
particular, we can look at this argument as it is
pre- sented in the fi  rst question in the
Ordinatio  (I, dist. II, q. i), and in the fi  rst 
book of the Reportata  (known as Reportatio  IA).
This hybrid approach will  enable us to extract
the basic argument from both the “early” and
“late”  Scotus, and from this we can then draw out
a central tension in the Scotist concept of
univocal immanence, a tension that is, we will
see, at the heart of the question of the concept
of Life. Scotus’ proof for the existence of God
is of a particular type. Scotus  does not simply
set out to prove that God is, but also, in a sense,
what God  is. This is how Scotus puts it in the
Reportatio : “Regarding the existence  of God, I
propose three questions. First, in the world of
beings, is there some being that is fi  rst in an
unqualifi  ed sense? Second, could several dif-
ferent sorts of being possess such primacy?
Third, is some being actually  infi nite in an
unqualifi  ed sense?” 50 The fi  rst two questions
have to do with  causality, and the necessity of
positing a fi  rst cause or prime mover for all 
creation. Scotus’ statement of these
questions would seem to imply that these
questions were not to be taken for granted. But
the third question is different, and it is this
question that appears in a nearly identical
form in the Ordinatio . Here we have not a string
of questions dealing with cau- sality, but a
single one dealing with infi  nity: “First I
inquire about those  things which pertain to the
unicity of God, and I ask fi  rst whether in the 
realm of beings something exists which is
actually infi  nite?” 51 The phrase “actually
infi  nite” is important, for it not only implies
an  ontology of the divine—that the divine
“is”—but it also stipulates the spe-cifi c
criteria for the being of the divine—that of its
actuality as opposed to  its potentiality, and
that of its existence as opposed to its essence.
Scotus is not just setting out to prove that the
divine exists, but the emphasis on ac-tual infi 
nity means that Scotus is also seeking to prove
what the divine is,  and even how it exists. These
latter points immediately evoke modal
ques-tions, questions about becoming,
change, and dynamics. But that which the modal
describes (as actually or potentially
existing) is something as abstract as the infi 
nite, understood in the Scholastic and
theological sense  as “being without category
.” Thus something that is actually infi  nite, as 
opposed to potentially infi  nite, would be infi 
nite in an immediate and ab- solute
sense—everything, everywhere, for all time.
This is, it would seem, a radically horizontal
concept of the divine. Although Scotus never
makes any claim for a pantheistic notion of the
divine-as-infi  nite, this notion of  “actual
infi  nity” places as much emphasis on the
immanent relations of  divine manifestation as
it does on the transcendental relations of
causal-ity between Creator and creature.

 190 chapter four There is, certainly, a rich
discourse on the infi  nite in modern math-
ematics and philosophy.52 But prior to this
modern mathematization, the  concept of the
infi  nite opens onto the general notion of the
boundless (in  space) and the limitless (in
time). That which is infi  nite is that which can-
not be bound in space or limited in time—and,
therefore, that which   cannot be categorized by
thought. This is, at least, the “naïve” view of 
infi nity. In the Scholastic theological
tradition, the divine is conceived as  that
which is neither a genus nor a species (that is,
God is not a creature  among other creatures, but
that by which the creation of creatures as
ge-nus and species is possible). To encircle
the divine within such a categori-cal
framework would be to negate the very concept of
the divine—as not only being above category of
thought, but as the very principle through
which category is possible. Scotus can thus
defi  ne the infi  nite as follows: “The infi  nite
is that  which exceeds the fi  nite, not exactly by
reason of any fi  nite measure,  but in excess of
any measure that could be assigned.” 53 The defi 
nition is  repeated almost exactly in the
Reportata . Keeping in mind our “naïve” 
perspective, there are two basic types of infi 
nity in Scotus’ defi  nition: a  numerable infi 
nity that is infi  nite because it extends
forever (in space) or  goes on forever (in time),
and a nonnumerable infi  nity that is infi  nite
be- cause it is simply beyond or above all
things. The fi  rst type of numerable  infi nity he
refers to as “relative” infi  nity, while the
second, nonnumerable  infi nity he refers to as
“absolute” infi  nity. Relative infi  nity deals
primar- ily with the divine-as-infi  nite in
relation to that which is not -divine. In  other
words, relative infi  nity deals with the
relation between Creator and  creatures. By
contrast, absolute infi  nity deals with the
divine-as-infi  nite  in itself. Here Scotus
runs into a methodological problem. The
divine, insofar  as it is defi  ned as that which is
absolutely beyond all natural knowledge  and
human comprehension, cannot really be
understood as the divine-as- infi nite in
itself. The concept of absolute infi  nity
forbids its own concep- tualization.
Therefore, one must get to the concept of
absolute infi  nity  (the divine-as-absolute)
through the back door—that is, through the
natu-rally knowable manifestations of the
divine in the relation between Cre-ator and
creature. This is a common strategy in
Scholastic thinking that can be traced back to
the Church Fathers. One cannot know the divine
in itself, but only secondarily, as it were,
through the effects of the divine in nature. But
Scotus will add a twist. While never disavowing
the relation of analogy between Creator and
creature, Scotus also makes strong claims for
the univocity of the relation between Creator
and creature. This we 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    206
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 191 saw in the previous chapter,
where Scotus positions himself vis-à-vis both 
Aquinas and Henry of Ghent. But, as we’ve seen,
this concept of univocity leads to a notion of
the divine nature that places as much emphasis
on its immanence (“within”) as its
transcendence (“above”). How then, to achieve
this dual emphasis on immanence as well as 
transcendence? The problem is not simply that
transcendence is “bad”— a claim of “theory”
that is quite foreign even to Medieval
pantheism. Rather, the problem for Scotus can
be stated as follows: how to corre- late two
conceptions of the divine into a single
concept: the concept of  transcendence—which
implies that there is a reality that actually
exists,  but which is not apparent to the senses
or to thought—and the concept of
immanence—which implies that that which is
transcendent is literally nowhere in
particular, precisely because it is
everywhere in general. 4.5.3 The Pathology of
the Triple Primacy Scotus’ approach to the
question of the divine nature is not simply to
prove its existence as such, but to imply that
the question of what it is and how it is be taken
simultaneously with the question that it is. In
so doing, Scotus will emphasize a notion of the
divine in terms of “actual infi  nity”—that it  is
at once transcendently infi  nite, in that it is
above and beyond all things,  but also that it is
immanently infi  nite, in that its infi  nity is
actual (every- thing, everywhere, all the
time). The questions through which Scotus
ad-dresses the problem of the divine nature are
twofold: First, is it possible to develop a
concept of the divine nature in itself that
would be accessible to natural knowledge (that
is, without relying on faith or revelation)?
From this there follows a second question: Is it
possible to develop a concept of the divine
nature in itself that would place a dual
emphasis on its imma-nence as well as its
transcendence (that is, without becoming
ensnared in pure antinomy)? This is, to be sure,
an ambitious endeavor. The fi  rst question
concern- ing natural knowledge of the divine in
itself is one that preoccupies Scho-lastic
thinking in general, with thinkers
positioning themselves all along a spectrum,
from mystical theology to nominalist logic.
The second ques-tion is more specifi  c to
Scotus—indeed, it is the second question that
folds  back onto the fi  rst question, and which
enables Scotus, via the emphasis  on uni v oci ty ,
th e “ comm on na ture , ” an d imman en ce , to assert
tha t th e divine  nature is also a divine nature .
Scotus’ approach in his proofs for the
existence of God has roughly  the same structure
in both the Oxford and Paris lectures. His
question 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    207
    </p></div><p>
    
 192 chapter four concerning the “actual infi 
nity” of the divine is, in both texts, divided 
into two parts—one approach, which deals with
the divine nature in itself  (“the absolute
properties of God”), and another approach,
which deals with the divine nature
relationally (“the relative properties of
God”). 54 As we’ve  seen, while Scotus aims to
address the former question, the paradox
inher-ent in the “in itself” of the divine
nature means that Scotus must gain access to the
divine through the backdoor—that is, through
the manifesta-tion of the divine in the
earthly, of the supernature in nature. This
latter approach concerning the relative
properties of the divine na- ture is in turn made
up of three components: a fi  rst component 
concerning  the primacy of the divine nature, a
second component  concerning the in-
terrelation of these primacies, and a third
component concerning the over- all unity of the
divine nature itself (in the Scholastic
obsession for neatness and numerology, each of
these components in turn has three
conclusions). Taken together, these
arguments lead Scotus into interesting
territory regarding the relation between the
immanence and transcendence of the divine
nature, especially regarding the possibility
of there being a “univo-cal immanence.” In the
fi  rst article of Ordinatio  I.II.i, Scotus lays
out his  strategy in summary form: Wherefore I
shall show that in the realm of beings something
indeed  exists which is simply fi  rst according
to efficiency, and also that some- thing exists
which is simply fi  rst in the order of ends, and
that some- thing exists which is simply fi  rst by
reason of pre-eminence ( eminen- tiam ).
Secondly, I shall show that what is fi  rst in
virtue of one kind of  primacy is also fi  rst in
virtue of the others. And thirdly, I shall show 
that this triple primacy ( triplex primitas )
pertains to but one nature,  so as not to be found
in several specifi  cally or essentially
different  natures.55 This approach,
emphasizing as it does the divine nature as
relational (“rel- ative properties of God”)
implies both the essential inaccessibility of
the divine in itself, while also maintaining
the pervasiveness of the divine in a way that is
not separate from its manifestation. We can
begin with the fi  rst component: the primacy of
the divine na- ture. Here Scotus utilizes an
argument concerning the “triple primacy” of
the divine: that the divine obtains its primacy
or transcendence, not via its absolute
separation or division from the earthly , but
from its relative, relational, and even
processual aspects. His focus is not just on
causality, but also on the ontological
grounding that makes causality possible (the 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    208
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 193 absolute preeminence of the
divine nature). The fi  rst two primacies deal 
with Aristotelian causality, and in
particular on efficient and fi  nal causal- ity
as it is manifested in the divine nature. The
argument concerning efficient causality and
fi  nal causality follow  similar lines of
argument, and they are arguments that are
common in  Scholastic discourse, though it is
possible to read Scotus as departing from these
mainstream arguments. Generally, the
argument concerning causal-ity is that, in
order for the concept of causality to hold, one
must presup-pose both a fi  rst cause as well as a
fi  nal end. But Scotus does not simply  mean “fi 
rst” and “fi  nal” in a chronological sense. A fi 
rst efficient cause is  not the fi  rst efficient
cause at time = 0, but rather that by which
causality  in itself is caused, or the
potentiality of cause. 56 Similarly, the fi  nal
cause  is not a chronological end time towards
which all things tend, but the de-terminate
organization or patterning of causal
relationships that allow us to analyze and
conceptualize causal relations to begin with.
57 Thus,  the primacy of efficient causality is
like the cause of causality, while the  primacy
of fi  nal causality is the organization
inherent in causality. Both,  Scotus notes, are
“actually existing,” and not simply potential
or possible existences. That is, their actual
existence is required as ontological
prin-ciples that ensure that causality is
continually in effect (efficient causal-ity)
and determinately patterned (fi  nal
causality). Scotus, while arguing  for the
transcendent primacy of efficient and fi  nal
causality, also sets cau- sality within a
domain of continual relation. Things seem to be
already in motion and in patterning . . .  There is
also a third primacy in addition to that of
efficient and fi  nal  causality, which Scotus
calls the primacy of “preeminence” (
eminentiae ).  In the same way that the primacy of
the fi  rst efficient cause is not liter- ally fi 
rst, and in the same way that the fi  nal cause is
not literally last, so  is the preeminence of the
divine nature not simply the most perfect in a
spectrum of perfection, the most complete in a
spectrum of the less- complete. 58 Scotus’
notion of preeminence at times comes close to
assert- ing a kind of idealism. After stating
that “some eminent nature is simply  fi rst in
perfection,” Scotus comments that “[t]his is
evident because an  essential order exists
among essences, for as Aristotle puts it, forms
are like numbers.” So the divine nature obtains
a primacy of preeminence be-cause it is not
simply a higher perfection among lesser
perfections, but is itself an essential,
abstract, even mathematical perfection. But
then, in the very next sentence, Scotus appears
to materialize this abstract preemi-nence in
terms of creation: “ And in such an order an
ultimate nature is to be found.” 59 The language
here is a mixture of Aristotelian formalism 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    209
    </p></div><p>
    
 194 chapter four and Neoplatonic exemplarism,
both assuming a basic distinction between 
abstract forms and their concrete
manifestations. The point of tension in the
triple primacy is the caveat that appears  for
each of them: that the efficient, fi  nal, and
preeminent primacy of the  divine nature be an
actual  primacy, and not simply potential, or
possible,  or, for that matter, even “virtual.”
Part of the reason for this stress on the 
actuality of the divine nature is the way in
which the problem is logically posed: there is
the necessity of a fi  rst cause, one that is “fi 
rst” ontologi- cally and not just
chronologically or serially. Such a fi  rst
cause cannot, by defi nition, itself be caused,
or else the series of causes would continue back 
forever, undermining the concept of causality
itself. This is, at least, the common form of the
argument in much Scholastic discourse, infl 
uenced  as it was by Aristotle. This idea is
explained by Scotus in the Reportatio : Rather,
the whole collection of what is caused depends
upon some  other prior cause that is not a part of
that collection, for then some-thing would be a
cause of itself. Since the whole collection of
depen-dents depends, it does so not upon
something that is part of that collec-tion,
because everything there is dependent.
Consequently it depends upon something that is
not part of that totality. And this I call the fi 
rst  efficient. Hence, even if there is an infi 
nity of causes, they still depend  upon
something that is not a part of that infi  nity. 60
The cause remains outside of its effects—we can
accept this, if only pro- visionally. But to
this Scotus adds something, a variation, in
effect, but one that places less emphasis on the
sovereignty of the cause vis-à-vis its
effects, and much more emphasis on the
immanence or univocity between cause and
effect: But no succession can continue indefi 
nitely except by virtue of some- thing
permanent that is coextensive with the
succession as a whole.  For no change in form is
perpetuated save by virtue of something
uni-form that is not a part of the succession
itself, since no part can persist throughout
the entire succession and still be only just a
part of it. 61 What Scotus seeks is a concept of
the divine nature in terms of causal- ity , such
that it is an “uncaused cause”—a bit like the
notion of an “un-created Creator.” This is
something like the condition for causality,
or, perhaps, the setting-into-motion of the
very possibility of causal relations
themselves. As we noted, this strange
uncausality  cannot itself be caused. 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    210
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 195 How then, can one account for
its existence at all? It cannot be thought  of in
terms over which it governs—causality,
relationality, process—for this only
necessitates a higher-level principle of
necessity . It must, there-fore, be both
uncaused and yet not nonexistent. It must be
both immateri-ally pervasive, as an
ontological ground, and yet manifestly
existent in the nexus of causal relations that
it occasions. In other words, the causality of
the divine nature must be both a transcendental
ground and an immanent manifestation. The
triple primacy is but one of three components of
the divine na- ture. The other two
components—the interrelation of the three
prima- cies, and the unity of the divine
nature—are meant to address the tensions that
develop out of the fi  rst component of the triple
primacy. The second   component—the
interrelation of the three primacies—sets
each of the pri- macies in relation to each
other. For instance, Scotus argues that the fi 
rst  cause is also a fi  nal cause, since the fi  rst
efficient cause is seen to act in  t erms  o f  i tse lf 
an d  fro m  i tse lf —a  kin d  o f  p rimary  se lf -ca usa ti
o n  o r  se lf - organization. 62 Similarly, Scotus
also argues that the fi  rst cause is also the 
preeminence of the divine nature, since the fi 
rst cause is not a genus or  species, or one among
the other causes, but that which conditions
causal- ity itself—“the supreme nature” (
primum eminens ).63 The interrelation of the
efficient, fi  nal, and preeminent primacies 
then leads Scotus to argue for their
fundamental unity, for not only are the three
primacies inseparable from each other, but the
self-causing and interrelational aspect of
the divine nature implies its univocity. 64
Scotus’  proof for the unity of the divine nature
is similar to that given in other places in his
works. It argues that any two entities A and B
must have both  a differentiating factor, or
“thisness” ( haecceitas ), as well as a univocal 
“common nature” that allows A and B to be set in
relation at all. These  two elements—the
“thisness” and the “common nature”—are not at
once distinct and yet inseparable. They
constitute a “formal objective distinc-tion”
whereby their distinction and unity are
neither simply in the mind of the perceiver nor
simply in the objective world. In the Ordinatio
, where  this argument appears, Scotus offers
another variant that is as dense as it is
intriguing: The efficient cause which is fi  rst
by this triple primacy is of itself neces-
sarily existent. Proof: It is completely
incapable of being caused, for it is 
contradictory that it should have anything
prior to it in the order of effi-ciency or fi 
nality . . . From this I argue, nothing can be
non-existent un- less something either
positively or privatively incompatible with
it can 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    211
    </p></div><p>
    
 196 chapter four exist. Now nothing can be
positively or privatively incompatible with a 
being which exists of itself and is totally
uncaused; therefore, etc.65 Here Scotus seems
to be making the same argument for univocity,
but this  time through a framework of
ontological negation. Negation or
nonexis-tence requires opposition, but of two
types: a positive or additive opposi-tion, in
which A is opposed by the addition of  B (where B = A
–1), and a priv- ative or subtractive
opposition, in which A′ is subtracted from A
(where  A′ = A i ts e lf  o r  s o m e  es s e n ce  o f  A) .  A  di vin
e  na tur e  tha t  is  d e fi  ned by  its primacy—that is,
by being uncaused or self-caused—has no
opposing term, and without this, it cannot be
nonexistent. Therefore it must exist. But it
cannot exist in the sense of caused existents,
for this would recuper-ate the divine nature
back into the sphere of causality and
oppositions (it would be a thing among things, a
cause among causes). It seems that the divine
nature’s unity is such that it is both existent
(in that it has no op-posing term) and
nonexistent (in that it does not exist in terms
of caused existents). Only a notion of the
divine nature that is literally no-thing,
precisely because it is every-thing, can fulfi 
ll these criteria. The divine  nature’s primacy
would have to be predicated on a strong notion of
imma-nence (or “univocal immanence”) rather
than one in which immanence is situated
secondarily with respect to an external,
transcendent causality. This is noteworthy
because many of Scotus’ other arguments for
uni- vocity and the divine immanence take place
via an additive or superlative gesture—one
begins with discrete entities A and B , and then
posits some- thing x that courses through them
or that conditions their very possibil- ity of
relation. The discrete individuations or
“thisness” point to a One, but this One derives
its unity via a horizontal relationality, One
becomes All. But in the above passage the
conditions are the opposite: univocity is
necessary because the One is All, and this
One-All is also, in a way, “noth-ing” (in
Scotus’ phrasing, nihil potest non esse ). From
one perspective, Scotus’ proofs for the
existence of God are really about the concept of
immanence, and its secondary relation to
transcen-dence. When Scotus asks, “is there a
being that is actually infi  nite?” we  can read
him as asking “is there a concept of immanence
that is not sub-ordinate to transcendence?”
And the way in which Scotus frames this inquiry
is through an emphasis on the processual or
dynamic aspects of the divine nature: the fi  rst
component of the triple primacy, the second 
component of their fundamental
interrelation, and the third component of
their essential unity.

  dark pantheism 197 The main challenge facing
Scotus is that there must be some ontologi- cal
ground that is at once transcendentally beyond
particular manifesta- tions and immanently
coursing through them. For the primacy of
efficient causality, this is the cause of
causality itself, the ontological grounding
of relation  that governs cause and effect. For
the primacy of fi  nal causality,  this is the
determinate organization of different
cause-effect chains, the  grounding of
patterning  tha t enab l es causal rela ti on to be
though t. An d  for the primacy of preeminence, we
have the exemplary idea of perfection  or
completion itself, the grounding of the
abstract  or the ideal. For Scotus,  the triple
primacy of the divine nature—if it is not simply
that which is  fi rst, fi  nal, or most perfect in
the gradation of things—is laced with con-
tradictions: it is the cause of all causes that
is itself not caused (in efficient causality);
it is the end of all ends that itself is not
directed towards any end (in fi  nal causality);
and it is the perfection of all imperfections
that is  not simply one among other beings (in
preeminence). Scotus’ conception of the
divine nature is structured around a number  of
internal tensions, tensions that are at once
Aristotelian and Neopla-tonic: a tension
between cause and effect, a tension between the
ideal and material, a tension between the
actual and the potential, and so on. In a sense,
these tensions arise from what can be seen to be
Scotus’ overall project: to think a concept of
univocal immanence as indissociable from  the
divine nature . On the one hand, Scotus’
arguments for the primacy  of the divine nature
imply transcendental attributes (the cause of
causal-ity, the end of fi  nality, the form of
perfection). On the other hand, Scotus’ 
central criterion for this transcendence of
the divine nature—and indeed for his proofs of
the existence of the divine in itself—is that
their modality be actually existent. This
means that it is without reserve, but also that
it is without incompletion. This is inherent to
the notion of primacy or preeminence itself, if
taken to mean “completion” or “fullness.” But
this static view of the fully actual is again put
into tension by the emphasis on the dynamic
causal relations of the efficient, the fi  nal,
and the com- pleted. Hence Scotus’ arguments
from causality open onto notions of rela-tion
and interrelation, of the divine in terms of
dunamis or fl  ow. And this  is the real lesson from
Scotus’ discourse on the divine nature—not
that it is a full-blown pantheism, but that it
reveals the contradictions between the
divine-as- plenum  and the divine-as-fl  ow—or,
put another way, Scotus’  proofs on the divine
nature reveal a relationship between two
notions of immanence— an immanence of fullness
and an immanence of fl  ow.

 198 chapter four 4.6 IMMANENCE III: NICHOLAS OF 
CUSA’S DE DOCTA IGNORANTIA As we’ve seen in the
example of Eriugena and Duns Scotus, the
concept  of immanence or univocity is central to
any ontology of life, insofar as “life” does not
remain exclusive to the natural domain. This
last point is central, for it not only raises the
question of the equivalence of the
su-pernatural and natural, “God or nature,”
but it also raises the possibility of a concept
of life that runs through the supernatural and
natural, when perceived as a continuum. The
tradition of speculative mysticism is worth
considering in this re- gard. The problem of how
far to push the concept of immanence in the
divine nature was a central concern of late
Scholastic and early modern thinking. It is
there, in a confl  icted way, in Descartes’
bifurcation of  thought and extension, in
Leibniz’s monad, and in Spinoza’s substance
monism. One also sees the problem of immanence
addressed by think-ers such as Nicholas of
Cusa, whose De Docta Ignorantia  (On Learned 
Ignorance ) remains emblematic of the limits
and tensions in the concept  of immanence. Cusa
is also known as the author of a treatise that
promoted, during a  time of tension between
Church and empire, a system of resolution based
on the balance of hierarchy and consent through
councils. This treatise, De  Concordantia
Catholica  (The Catholic Concordance ), would
have an in- fl uence on the growing “conciliar”
movement, though schisms of all types  between
pope and king continued throughout the
fourteenth and fi  fteenth  centuries. In the
latter part of his life Cusa was named cardinal
and then bishop, serving as papal legate until
his death. In his politics—not unlike his
philosophy—Cusa refl  ects an amalgam of
tendencies, at once encour- aging the
preservation of politico-religious
hierarchy, and yet also promot-ing a more
progressive lateralization of deliberation
through councils. 66 Cusa’s De Docta
Ignorantia  was written around 1440, and
belongs to  a set of Cusan
philosophical-mystical works that also
includes De Quae-rendo Deum  (On Seeking God ),
Dialogus de Deo Abscondito  (Dialogue  on the
Hidden God ), and De Visione Dei  (On the Vision of
God ). 67 The De  Docta Ignorantia  is composed of
three books, each with subdivided chap- ters.
The fi  rst book deals with the divine nature in
itself, the second book  with nature or the
created world, and the third with their
combination in the fi  gure of Christ, the
god-man. As the title indicates, the premise  of
Cusa’s philosophical and mystical outlook is
that human, natural un-derstanding of the
divine or supernatural is always determined by
a ho-

  dark pantheism 199 rizon of thought, and this
thought itself is a kind of dark illumination, a 
“learned ignorance.” This idea—that the
divine is precisely the thought of the
unthought—is also found in earlier mystical
writings, such as those by Augustine, the
Pseudo-Dionysius, and Eckhart, and their infl 
uence is re- fl ected in Cusa’s own references.
What remains of interest in Cusa’s spec-
ulative mysticism, however, is his evocations
of an unknown divinity—as  per his many
suggestions of an unknown nature , a nature so
thoroughly  conceptualized in terms of
immanence that, as Cusa would note, “God is  in
all things and all things are in God.” 4.6.1 The
Coincidence of Opposites A central component
of Cusa’s thought is a sort of non-synthetic
monism. That is, Cusa’s concept of the divine is
an ontological monism that pre-serves
oppositions and contradictories, rather than
simply effacing or el-evating them.
Nevertheless, Cusa’s thought is monist, and it
is monist in the sense that all things reduce to a
single entity, which Cusa refers to as the
“maximum.” This maximum is absolute, in that it
is nonnumerical, without measure, and
encompasses everything. The maximum is, in
Cu-sa’s words, “that beyond which there can be
nothing greater.” 68 To describe  this absolute
maximum ( maximum absolutum ), Cusa frequently
evokes a  mystical trope from geometry: the
circle whose center is everywhere, and 
circumference nowhere. For Cusa, the divine is
this absolute maximum, and a key feature of  the
absolute maximum is what Cusa calls the
coincidentia oppositorum ,  the “coincidence
of opposites.” In the created, natural world,
things ap-pear distinct and separate from each
other. The existence of oppositions of all
types—the supernatural vs. the natural, the
living vs. the dead, the present vs. the
past/future, matter vs. form, etc.—all these
imply a fi  nite  world in which such oppositions
are possible. Using the opposition of large and
small, Cusa argues that the very conditions of
opposition point to a larger, fundamentally
incomprehensible unity: Maximum quantity is
maximally large, while minimum quantity  is
maximally small. Therefore, if you free
maximum and minimum from quantity by
intellectually removing “large” and “small,”
you will clearly see that maximum and minimum
coincide. For both maxi-mum and minimum are
superlatives. Therefore, absolute quantity
is not maximum quantity more than it is minimum
quantity, because in it the minimum is the
maximum in a coincident way. 69

    </p></div><p>
    
 200 chapter four Borrowing a technique from
mystical theology, Cusa removes the quali- fi
ers of “large” and “small,” and what remains is a
single continuum of de- grees. He begins from
oppositions in the world (large vs. small), and
then,  subtracting the qualifying terms,
arrives at something that is not oppo-sition
but instead “coincidence.” The infi  nitely
large and the infi  nitely  small become one and
the same, the maximum the minimum,
culminat-ing in a single ontological
principle that underlies all reality: “the
maxi-mum is such that in it the minimum is
maximum, so that the maximum infi nitely and
completely transcends all opposition.” 70 I t
is easy to see th e appeal of this m o v e from a m ys ti
cal - th eo l ogi cal  standpoint, since it
provides a way of thinking about theophany. All
things in the natural world can be viewed as
unifi  ed by a single, divine source  that is both
its cause and its foundation. The problem,
ontologically speak- ing, is that this tends to
reify the world in two ways: fi  rst, it frames the 
world in terms of an anthropomorphized
Creator-creature, with all com- prehension of
the latter relying on an impossible
comprehension of the for-mer; second, it
places the essence or foundation of the world in
something outside of it, as opposed to
something internal to it or inherent in it. Now,
Cusa was both a philosopher and a mystic, and as
such, he certainly does not deny the absolute
transcendence of the divine or its ontological
foun-dation. But in other ways, he actively
avoids both the anthropomorphic, personal
Creator-God, as well as the transcendence of
the Neoplatonic One. How does he do this? In his
discussion of the concept of the maximum, Cusa
is careful to  point out that the coincidentia
oppositorum  does not simply imply the 
synthesis of all oppositions. While the
absolute maximum “infi  nitely and  c o m p l e t e l y  t
r a n s c e n d s  a l l  o p p o s i t i o n , ”  t h i s  d o e s  n o t  m e a n  t
h a t  i t  t r a n -scends all contradiction.
Likewise, the coincidence of opposites is not
sim-ply the synthesis of opposites. In the
divine all distinct and separate things are
regarded as one— as they are, in their
contradictory facticity . But such  a thought
would mean that, if there is an ontological
monism, it would have to be one that is not
synthetic, but a kind of disjunctive unity—a
dis- junctive monism . How is it possible to
think an ontological monism that  remains
disjun cti v e in this sense ? On e so l u ti on tha t
Cusa offers is tha t one would have to think any
principle of monism as fully immanent to all
that through which it is, a principle that spans
across rather than rises above:  “But it [the
absolute maximum] is a ‘this’ in such a way that
it is all  things, and it is all things in such a way
that it is none of them, and it is a ‘this’
maximally in such a way that it is also a ‘this’
minimally.” 71 It is in response to this
problematic—how to think an ontological mo-

  dark pantheism 201 nism that is also
disjunctive, or non-synthetic—that we see the
language  of pantheism recur throughout Cusa’s
writings. While the term is not used by Cusa, the
idea of the maximum as “in” all things, and all
things as “in” the maximum, is a touchstone in
the De Docta Ignorantia . Pantheism in  Cusa’s
work is more than the presence of the divine in
the natural world; it is a way of conceptually fl 
attening the “vertical” relation between the 
supernatural and natural, while maintaining
the “lateral” internal differ- entiations
that inhere in the world. 4.6.2 The Folds of Life
Cusa develops his own particular brand of
pantheism through several concepts, which we
can examine here—the twin concepts of
complica- tio (enfolding) and explicatio 
(unfolding), and the concept of contractio  
(contraction). The concepts of enfolding (
complicatio ) and unfolding ( ex- plicatio ) are
used by Cusa to account for the relation between
God and the  world, the supernatural and the
natural. Cusa borrows the terms from a passage
by Hermes Trismegistus, in which the divine is
described as all- encompassing, as folding all
things within itself. The root of the terms 
themselves, pli, evokes the process of folding
or wrapping (perhaps as one  would fold sheets of
paper into a folio). We might say that with
enfold- ing, the terms a ′ and a ″ are enveloped in
a , and that with unfolding, the  terms a′ and a ″
are developed out of a. “God, therefore, is the
enfolding  of all in the sense that all are in God,
and God is the unfolding of all in the sense that
God is in all.” 72 This runs like a leitmotif
throughout the  De Docta Ignorantia . All things
in the world are enveloped or enfolded in  God,
while God is manifest only as developed or
unfolded in all the things in the world. Cusa
uses these terms in different ways, however. In
some cases they are used to imply a full
immanence between God and nature, while in
other instances they serve to reinforce the
irrevocable separation and hierarchy between
them. Consider the fi  rst process, that of
enfolding. Enfolding describes the  way that
something exists within its principle, as that
principle. Some-thing is actual or potential,
possible or impossible, coming-to-be or 
passing- away, by virtue of being enfolded in
something else, which is its principle or
essence. Thus, when Cusa says that “ all things
are enfolded in God, ” this does not mean that all
things are sublimated into the divine unity as
so many parts to a whole, but rather that all
things inhere in the divine in their
differentiations and their individuations.
This implies that the unity of all things does
not lie above and beyond them, but is rather
consonant

 202 chapter four with them. When Cusa inverts
his previous statement and says that “God  is in
all things,” this likewise does not mean that
the divine is parsed out among things, but that
the divine courses through all individuations
and differentiations: “Therefore there is one
enfolding of all times—which is the present,
and the present, indeed, is unity. In the same
way, identity is the enfolding of difference,
equality the enfolding of inequality, and
sim-plicity the enfolding of divisions or
distinctions.” 73 Statements such as these
reveal the tensions within Cusa’s pantheism. 
On the one hand, there is a decisive separation
between terms, as well as  a prioritizing
between them (identity-difference, where the
former is more fundamental than the latter,
etc.). But, on the other hand, such separations
serve to reinforce the connection between
them, resulting in the coinci-dence of
oppositions. “In this way the infi  nite
providence of God enfolds  both the things that
will happen and also those that will not but can
hap-pen, and it enfolds contraries, as a genus
enfolds contrary differentiae.” 74 Something
similar can be said for the process of
unfolding. For Cusa,  unfolding is not exactly
the mirror image of enfolding. While the
enfold-ing of all things in God obtains a
certain perfection, the unfolding of all
things from God is seen to move further away from
that perfection. If we understand unfolding as
a process of manifestation or theophany, then
any instance of unfolding will imply the prior
existence of enfolding; what is unfolded was
always already enfolded. As Cusa notes, “[T]o
posit enfold-ing is not to posit the thing that
was enfolded, but to posit unfolding is also to
posit enfolding.” 75 In a sense, we might also
say, what is natural  was always already
supernatural. This asymmetry between
enfolding and unfolding is most evident in
Cusa’s evocations of pantheism: There is,
consequently, one enfolding of all things;
there is not one en- folding of substance,
another of quality or of quantity, and so on, for
there is only one maximum, with which the
minimum coincides and in which enfolded
difference is not opposed to enfolding
identity . . . God, therefore, is the enfolding
of all in the sense that all are in God, and God is
the unfolding of all in the sense that God is in
all. 76 Cusa’s pantheism is of a particular
type; it operates more via negations  than
positive assertions. The refrain that Cusa
employs—that God is in all things and all things
are in God—has to be understood negatively. It
is not a mereology of parts and wholes, for the
divine cannot be understood by additively or
cumulatively piling up all that exists.
Neither is it a topology of the One and the Many,
since the divine is not a One that is composed 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    218
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 203 of Many, even infi  nite,
parts. It is not a participation of the Many in
the  One, or of the material in the ideal, since
the divine is not separate from  its
participations. Finally, it is not an
exemplarism of Idea and its instan-tiation, or
a theophany of source and product, for the
divine is not simply the perfection of each
thing, but rather inheres in its existence as
actual or potential, as possible or
impossible. Enfolding and unfolding are thus
ways of accounting for the natural  world in
three ways: (i) they describe the way something
exists as individ-uated from and apart from its
principle of individuation; (ii) they
describe the way something exists as
differentiated from other things; (iii) they
re-quire that the principle of a thing and its
instantiation be thought together in a single
thought. This last point is important, for it
takes Cusa beyond Peripatetic natural
philosophy into a consideration of a pantheism
of pure immanence between the supernatural and
natural, God and world. However, given Cusa’s
tendency to both separate and unite God and 
world, how does he account for the relations
between the processes of en- folding and
unfolding themselves? It is here that another
of Cusa’s central concepts—that of contractio 
or contraction—enters the picture: In the
First Book it was shown that God is in all things
in such a  way that all things are in God, and now it
is evident that God is in all things, as if, by
mediation of the universe. It follows, then,
that all are in all and each is in each . . . In each
creature, the universe is the creature, and
each receives all things in such a way that in
each thing all are contractedly this thing.
Since each thing cannot be actually all things,
for it is contracted, it contracts all things,
so that they are it. 77 The processes of
enfolding and unfolding are themselves
related by con- traction. On a general level,
contraction for Cusa is the restriction of the
divine, as absolute maximum, into the world, or
what Cusa calls the “con-tracted maximum.”
What the absolute maximum is to God, the
contracted maximum is to the world; what the
absolute is to the supernatural, the
contracted is to the natural. For Cusa,
contraction is the means by which God is in all
things, the means by which the absolute maximum
(God) becomes the contracted maximum (world).
But contraction also works in the opposite
direction, via a delimitation or
dedifferentiation of the world in God: For just
as God, because God is boundless, is neither in
the sun nor in  the moon, although in them God is
absolutely that which they are, so 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    219
    </p></div><p>
    
 204 chapter four the universe is neither in the
sun nor in the moon but in them is con- tractedly
that which they are. The absolute quiddity of
the sun is not other than the absolute quiddity
of the moon . . . But the contracted quiddity of
the sun is other than the contracted quiddity of
the moon, for whereas the absolute quiddity of a
thing is not the thing, the con-tracted
quiddity is not other than the thing . . . But God
is not in the sun “sun” and in the moon “moon”;
rather God is that which is sun and moon without
plurality and difference. 78 Thus, to God,
which is nature without differentiations, is
paired nature,  which is the unity of all
differentiations. The process of
contraction—as the relation between
enfolding and unfolding—is thus
counterpoised to the non-process of the
absolute, which both encompasses everything
and is, in Cusa’s language of mysticism,
without circumference (see fi  gure 4). We thus
have two sets of terms that Cusa utilizes in his
pantheistic  philosophy: enfolding and
unfolding ( complicatio  and explicatio ), and
the  absolute and the contracted ( absolutum  and
contractum ). Enfolding and  unfolding work
through contraction to give us the world, which
Cusa de-scribes as a “contracted maximum.”
Likewise, enfolding and unfolding work
through the absolute to point to the horizon of
the divine, which Cusa refers to as the
“absolute maximum.” 4.6.3 ABSOLUTE VS.

  dark pantheism 205 nevertheless, closely
related. There is, fi  rst, an encompassing,
enveloping,  overarching process of
enfolding, in which all that is and is not is
onto- logically contained in the divine or
supernatural. To this is paired a move-ment of
unfolding that cuts across, fl  ows through, and
is pervasive among  all things in the world. The
fi  rst is a vertical immanence, an immanence 
between God and world, supernatural and
natural. This vertical imma-nence is the
immanence of theology, the immanence of God in
the world. What results from this is an absolute
pantheism  in which God and nature  are
identical, or, alternately, in which God and
the world are reciprocally and asymmetrically
folded in each other. The second type of
immanence is a lateral immanence, an immanence
that operates between each indi-viduation, in
which “each thing is in each thing.” This
lateral immanence is the immanence of natural
philosophy, the immanence of each thing in ea c h 
thing .  T hi s  gi v es  us  a  contracted pantheism ,
one in which nature  is in fact self-emergent and
coextensive with itself. Together, these two
kinds of immanence form the two aspects of
Cusa’s pantheism—the im-manence of the
supernatural in the natural, and the immanence
of the natural in itself. A brief recap of Cusa’s
pantheism is in order. There is, fi  rst, the
coin- cidence of opposites ( coincidenta
oppositorum ) that underlies all reality,  a
principle of ontological monism (or
disjunctive monism) that Cusa re-fers to as the
maximum (or absolute maximum). Here Cusa makes
a sub- distinction between opposition
(greater vs. lesser) and coincidence (greater 
and lesser). This coincidence of opposites is
achieved through the twin processes of
enfolding ( complicatio ) and unfolding (
explicatio ), in which  nature is enfolded in
God, and God is unfolded in nature. As a subset,
this gives us two types of immanence—a vertical
immanence between God and nature, and a lateral
immanence of nature with itself. The means by
which enfolding and unfolding occur—that is,
the relation between en-folding and unfolding
itself—is that of contraction, or the
delimitation of God in relation to nature. This
also gives us a subset, in which we have an
absolute pantheism (God in nature) and a
contracted pantheism (nature in itself). In a
sense, Cusa’s pantheism is caught between a
fully immanent   pantheism—a pure immanence of
supernatural and natural, God and  world—and a
tempered, transcendental pantheism (or,
perhaps, a panen-theism) in which God, as
absolute maximum, transcends the world by its
very encompassing of the world, and the
coincidence of all its opposites. Yet, even in
this transcendental mode, the way in which Cusa
places the divine, as absolute maximum, beyond
the pale of the world, invites further 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    221
    </p></div><p>
    
 206 chapter four questions. The divine is not
transcendental simply because it causes, cre-
ates, or governs the world (as it is in Aquinas,
for example). For Cusa, the divine is
transcendental because, as the absolute
maximum, as the point where maximum and minimum
are identical, at this point, the divine
re-mains forever outside the reach of human
thought and comprehension. The divine is
transcendental, for Cusa, because it is
absolutely equivocal. This is, certainly,
part of the impulse behind Cusa’s approach of
specu- lative mysticism, and it can be
witnessed in his other writings, such as the De
Visione Dei . What is noteworthy is that Cusa
will often describe  this condition less in
terms of mystical poetry and more in terms of
philo- sophical logic. Consider, for
instance, the following passage, where Cusa,
after having set out the distinction between
God and nature and Creator and creation,
proceeds to deconstruct such distinctions:
Who, therefore, can understand the being of the
creation by uniting in  it both the absolute
necessity from which it exists and the
contingency without which it does not exist? It
seems that the creation, which is neither God
nor nothing, is, as it were, subsequent to God
and prior to nothing and between God and nothing
. . . And yet the creation can-not be composed of
being and not-being. It seems, therefore,
neither to be, since it descends from being, nor
not to be, since it is before noth-ing, nor a
composite of both. Indeed, our intellect,
which cannot leap beyond contradictories,
does not reach the being of creation either by
division or by composition . . . Derived being,
therefore, is not under-standable, since the
being from which it exists is not
understandable. 79 Passages like this are not
uncommon in the De Docta Ignorantia ; indeed, 
from Cusa’s vantage point, they point to the
horizon of our ability to think  the divine at
all. Put another way, the thought of the divine
is not simply, in the Anselmian manner, the
limit of thought; it is, more specifi  cally, the 
thought of contradiction itself. In this
sense, “pantheism” is not simply the
omnipresence of the divine in nature, but the
full immanence of the divine, as unknowable
contradiction, throughout nature: But the
absolutely maximum transcends all our
understanding, which  i s  u n a b l e  b y  t h e  p a t h  o f  r e

source, for we proceed by means of the things
made evident to us by nature, and reason,
falling far short of this infi  nite power,
cannot join  together contradictories, which
are infi  nitely distant. 80

  dark pantheism 207 The Cusan notion of “learned
ignorance” is closely related to the form  of
pantheism put forth in the De Docta Ignorantia ,
and it is important  t o  u n d e r s t a n d  C u s a ’ s  e v o c a t
i o n s  o f  t h e  l i m i t s  o f  t h o u g h t  w i t h i n  t h i s  
framework. In this regard, Cusa sets up for
himself a particular problem. The  central
concepts of enfolding ( complicatio ) and
unfolding ( explicatio ) dy- namically produce
a continuum in which, as Cusa notes, the maximum
becomes minimum, and vice-versa. Enfolding
and unfolding together re-structure the ideas
of the supernatural and natural, in effect fl 
attening the  relation between God and nature,
Creator and creature. This has a number of
effects: fi  rst, it lateralizes the vertical,
governmental hierarchy between  God and
nature, the one implicated in the other, and
each implicated in each. Second, it removes the
ontological need for intermediaries, be it in
the Neoplatonic guise of primordial causes or
in the Peripatetic guise of h y l o m o rp h i c  c a u s a t
i o n .  T hir d ,  i t  di s p l a c e s  t h in kin g  f r o m  t h e  s t ri
c t ur e s  of ei ther dogmatic theo l ogy or a theo l
ogical m etaph ysics, both of which require a
principle of transcendence as a condition of
any principle of immanence. The logical
conclusion of these effects of complicatio  and
explicatio  is  the Cusan refrain, “God is in all
things in such a way that all things are  in God.”
81 If this is indeed a pantheism, then it is one
that has a number of  key requirements to it: (i)
that the co-implication of the supernatural
and  the natural be predicated on a principle of
pure immanence, and (ii) that this immanence of
the supernatural and the natural be
inseparable from a dynamic, processual life of
complicatio  and explicatio . What is imma-
nent, in this Cusan pantheism, are the vitalist
processes of folding ( pli- care) themselves.
Pantheism, in this sense, means neither that
the divine  is natural, nor that the natural is
divine, but that the co-implication of the
supernatural and natural takes place through a
conjunction of immanence and vitalism. But
this means that Cusa is then faced with the
absolute indistinction  between supernatural
and natural, God and nature. What is to prevent
this type of pantheism from becoming
all-encompassing, such that there is nothing
that is not within the ambit of this “absolute
maximum”? Cusa does not outright dispense with
the relations of mediation, hierarchy , or
causality in his evocations of pantheism. As
we’ve noted, the immanence of enfolding and
unfolding is always doubled by Cusa’s
reaffirmation of the asymmetry of this
immanence (that is, unfolding is a descent or
derivation from a divine source, whereas
enfolding always obtains a higher unity).

 208 chapter four Cusa’s pantheism—as a
conjunction of immanence and vitalism—stands 
in an ambivalent relation to his
reaffirmations of the sovereign
transcen-dence of the divine as absolute
maximum. The processes of enfolding and
unfolding are no more caused by God than is
nature; the question of will, so indicative of a
doctrinal, anthropomorphized God, is
conspicuously ab-sent in Cusa’s De Docta
Ignorantia . Added to this ambivalence is
another. The conjunction of immanence  and
vitalism is really a tension, almost a
contradiction. Pure immanence, in
traditional theological terms, denotes a
spatialized plenum , a fullness  and actuality
of the divine in all that is. By contrast, the
movements of  enfolding and unfolding are
dynamic processes, which, though they are not
about creation in the divine, Genesis -sense,
they are about the im- manent, ongoing creation
of the continuum God-nature (God in all things, 
all things in God). At the heart of Cusa’s
pantheism is a tension, then, between an
immanence of the divine that is a plenum , and the
processes  of enfolding/unfolding that is a
dunamis ; an immanence that is placid, 
expansive, and silent, and a vitalism that is
always folding, creating, and  producing;
something that is everywhere, all at once, and
fully actual, and something that is nowhere,
continually differentiating, and fully
virtual. In short, the tension within the Cusan
notion of pantheism is really about the
contraction between immanence and life. In the
De Docta Ignorantia  Cusa offers what may be
regarded as some- what disappointing,
conciliatory solutions to these problems. He
does this throughout the text by repeatedly
insisting on the asymmetrical distinc-tion
between God and nature—for instance, in the
distinction between the absolute and the
contracted maximum, the former the divine in
itself, and the latter the unfolded nature.
This is, in turn, predicated on a ba-sic
correlation between God and nature that,
despite the frequent evoca-tions of
pantheism, still serves to inform Cusa’s
overall system. Finally, in the third book Cusa
offers a doctrinal compromise by way of a fi  gure
of   mediation—Christ, as the god-man,
embodying in himself both the abso- lute and
contracted maximum, both God and nature. Even
here, however, in these all-too-human
resolutions, Cusa’s language enters a zone of
poetic obscurity, suggesting that the
absolute is never quite absolute, just as the
contracted is never quite contracted. 82 In
highlighting the role of pantheism and its
attendant tensions, we  a r e ,  o b v i o u s l y ,  c h o o s i
n g  t o  r e a d  C u s a ’ s  De Docta Ignorantia  in a very 
particular way. Nevertheless, there are one
basic argument and one basic question to come
out of this exegesis. The argument: for a
concept of pan-theism in Cusa that is a
conjunction of immanence and life. And the
ques-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

  dark pantheism 209 tion: whether such a
pantheism can be thought without itself
becoming  defi ned by contradiction. 4.6.4
Speculative Pantheism (Deleuze’s
Interlocutors) These are precisely the points
that Gilles Deleuze highlights in his own, 
Spinozist-infl  ected reading of Cusa. Or, we
might do better to say that  Deleuze’s
understanding of Spinoza, and of Spinoza’s own
pantheism, is  uniquely indebted to the
“post-Scholastic” pantheism of Cusa. As
Deleuze notes, “The traditional couple of
explicatio  and complicatio  historically  refl
ects a vitalism never far from pantheism [ un
vitalisme toujours proche  du panthéisme ].” 83
And, in this vein, what Spinoza accomplishes is
to  “restore a Philosophy of Nature” to a place
beyond the terms set out by Descartes. However,
Deleuze is also careful to distance the
pantheism of Cusa and Spinoza from “vitalism”
in its biologistic vein. If the processes of
complicatio  and explicatio  are vitalist, this
is because they have to do  with the constant
creation and innovation of forms, not because
they te- leologically lead to the animal, the
organism, or the species. This is an im-portant
move, and it characterizes nearly all
Deleuze’s writing on Spinoza. This
gesture—pulling vitalism away from biology
and reconnecting it to pantheism—is also found
in a more subtle way in Maurice de Gandillac’s
writing on Cusa. 84 Gandillac, who was
Deleuze’s advisor for Difference  and
Repetition , also points to the inherently
dynamic, processual quali- ties of
complicatio  and explicatio . Signifi  cantly,
he also warns against an  understanding of such
processes that would reduce them to biology: “
Ex- plicatio  could not, therefore, be the
simple unrolling of a fi  lm of all eter- nity
already wound up, like the ‘preformed’ leaves (
feuilles ) of a bud, or the  miniature animal in
germinal form as imagined by the adversaries of
‘epi-genesis.’” 85 If the Cusan terms
complicatio  and explicatio  are to be under-
stood in a vitalist way, this is not because they
produce already- existent  forms of life; it is,
instead, because they are temporalized
processes that are defi  ned by a superlative
generosity (an excess that is always creating, 
inventing, and so on). If Deleuze’s
understanding of Spinoza is structurally
indebted to his  understanding of Cusa, it is in
the Spinozist philosophy of nature that one fi 
nds the Cusan terms taken to their extreme.
However, the way in  which Spinoza accomplishes
this is also quite different from that of Cusa.
Whereas Cusa, not unlike Eckhart or Bruno, will
utilize the method of speculative mysticism,
in the Ethics  Spinoza opts for a more rigorous,
“ax- iomatic” approach to understanding the
relation between God and Nature.

 210 chapter four This point is made by Ferdinand
Alquié in his 1958–59 lectures on Spinoza. 
Alquié, who served as Deleuze’s advisor for
Expressionism in Philosophy ,  will likewise
warn against the biologistic reading of
pantheism—in this  case, in regard to Spinoza’s
naturalism: In effect, this idea of a
self-sufficient Nature, of a substantial
Nature,  of a divine Nature, of a Nature that is
co-existent with God, is not Spinozist, but a
product of the Renaissance . . . What, then,
constitutes the profound originality of
Spinoza? What will fi  nally permit this nat-
uralism of the Renaissance to depart from the
mystical confusion in which it remains? . . .
What will permit Spinoza to give to spiritual
processes a rational and precise sense, what
will permit him to think Nature apart from all
the shadows of fi  nality, will be the
mathematical  method, and that alone. 86 This
nonreductive pantheism is not a form of
idealism; it is not the case  that Spinoza simply
abstracts the biological or natural into a
Platonic do-main. For Alquié, the key to this
lies in Spinoza’s refusal to see mathe-matical
truths and biological-naturalistic truths as
mutually exclusive. As Alquié notes, “[B]y way
of considering the mathematical theory in
relation to the biological theory, which was
that of Aristotle, we are witness to an
important transformation in the defi  nition of
truth.” 87 That transforma- tion entails not
only a naturalism but an ontology, not only a
philosophy of nature (a pantheism), but also an
ontology of immanence. The Cusan “coincidence
of opposites,” where the maximum is the  minimum
and vice-versa, is streamlined in Spinoza into
a single, univocal substance—one substance
for all attributes. This univocal substance
is, in Spinoza’s celebrated phrase, “God or
nature,” one and the same. This univocal
substance may be expressed through the
attributes (for Spinoza, the attributes of
thought or extension). Hence Cusa’s twofold,
vitalist pro-cesses of enfolding and
unfolding are, in Spinoza, an array of
attributes whose dynamic is that of
“expression.” These attributes in turn
express the multiplicity of modes (for
example, modes of speed or slowness,
affect-ing or being affected). The Cusan
process of contraction into nature is, in
Spinoza, the expression of modes of movement
and affect. However, for Deleuze, Spinoza does
more than simply extend the ba- sic tenets of
Cusan pantheism. Deleuze outlines two signifi 
cant modifi  ca- tions that Spinoza effects to
Cusan pantheism. The fi  rst is to note that the 
important thing about types of folding in Cusa (
complicatio  and explica- tio) is not what they
produce, or what is unfolded, but rather the
process 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    226
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 211 of creation itself. Thus,
Deleuze proposes that what Cusa calls
explicatio   is actually two, coupled
processes: involvere  (infolding, involving,
impli- cating) and explicare  (unfolding,
evolving, explicating). These two pro- cesses
are not in opposition to each other, but are like
two sides of the  same page. Deleuze’s
distinction between involvere  and explicare 
further  points to their synthesis in a third
term: “Precisely because the two con-cepts are
not opposed to one another, they imply a
principle of synthesis: complicatio .” 88 In
his reading of Cusa-Spinoza, Deleuze suggests
that there are actu- ally three terms in play:
involvere  (to implicate), explicare  (to
explicate),  and complicare  (to complicate).
These are all “terms inherited from a long 
philosophical tradition, always subject to
the charge of pantheism.”89 What  unites them,
what is common to each process, though infl 
ected in differ- ent ways, is what Deleuze calls
“expression”: To explicate is to evolve, to
involve is to implicate. Yet the two terms  are
not opposites: they simply mark two aspects of
expression. Expres-sion is on the one hand an
explication, an unfolding of what expresses
itself, the One manifesting itself in the Many
(substance manifesting itself in its
attributes, and these attributes manifesting
themselves in their modes). Its multiple
expression, on the other hand, involves Unity.
The One remains involved in what expresses it,
imprinted in what unfolds it, immanent in
whatever manifests it. 90 The concept of
expression frames Deleuze’s entire book on
Spinoza.  Though the term is not frequently used
by Spinoza himself, Deleuze expands it to talk
about the concept of creation itself. Rather
than take crea ti on  as  a  term  fram ed  b y  th e  re la ti
onshi p  o f  God - na ture  o r  C rea to r -creation,
where the former term would express the latter
term as some thing, expression in its Spinozist
guise is about the enfolding and unfold-ing
between two terms (in this case, “God or
nature”). “Expression in gen-eral involves
and implicates what it expresses, while also
explicating and evolving it.” 91 Expression is
the dynamic that does not express any thing, 
except itself; in this sense expression is the
demonstration of the univoc-ity or immanence
between God and nature, the supernatural and
natural. This is, in a sense, an inversion of the
approach of speculative mysti- cism, which, in
its more dogmatic vein, always rises up through
succes-sive abstractions to a horizon beyond
which thought cannot go. Tradi-tional
mysticism always draws together and raises
up—this is evidenced in book 3 of Cusa’ s De Docta
Ignorantia , where the problematic of pan-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    227
    </p></div><p>
    
 212 chapter four theism elicits a conservative
response. By reading Cusa through Spinoza’s 
more rigorous version of pantheism, Deleuze
suggests not a speculative mysticism, but a
speculative pantheism, one that always
descends and spreads out—either in terms of the
delimitations of complicatio , or in the 
proliferations of explicatio . In Deleuze, the
Cusan terms of complicatio   and explicatio  are
transformed by Spinoza into a philosophical
pantheism  in which the supernatural and
natural, the material and spiritual, are con-
tinually folded into each other: In Spinoza,
Nature at once comprises and contains
everything, while  being explicated and
implicated in each thing. Attributes involve
and explicate substance, which in turn
comprises all attributes. Modes in-volve and
explicate the attribute on which they depend,
while the at-tribute in turn contains the
essences of all modes. 92 With Cusa, we saw how
the injunction of pantheism led to a central
ten- sion, a tension between the immanence of
the divine nature and the vital-ist processes
of complicatio and explicatio . At the core of
Cusan panthe- ism is a contradiction between
immanence and life. The Spinozist concept of
expression suggests not a contradiction, but,
true to Cusa’s thought, a coincidence of
immanence and life, a spatialized fullness and
a temporal-ized creativity. The pantheism in
Spinoza is, then, different from the pantheism
in  Cusa. Nevertheless, the conjunction of
immanence and life is central to any ontology of
pantheism. But what is a point of tension, or
even contra-diction, in Cusa, itself becomes
the principle of immanence in Spinoza—this is
Deleuze’s argument, at least. This means that
to the pantheism of Cusa and Spinoza, we must
also bear in the mind the pantheism of De-leuze,
in his particular readings of the former two
thinkers. Let us, then, move from a
consideration of Deleuze’s reading of Cusan
pantheism more directly to his reading of
Spinozist pantheism. 4.7 PANTHEISM AND PURE
IMMANENCE  In Expressionism in Philosophy ,
Deleuze explicitly frames Spinoza’s con-
cepts in terms of pantheism: Spinoza accepts
the truly philosophical “danger” of immanence
and  pantheism implicit in the notion of
expression. Indeed he throws in his 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    228
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 213 lot with that danger. In
Spinoza the whole theory of expression sup-
ports univocity; and its whole import is to free
univocal Being from a state of indifference or
neutrality, to make it the object of a pure af-fi
r m a t i o n ,  w h i c h  i s  a c t u a l l y  r e a l i z e d  i n  a n  e x p r e
s s i v e  p a n t h e i s m  o r   immanence. 93 Statements
such as these can be read as applying equally to
Deleuze’s phi- losophy itself as to that of
Spinoza. Deleuze’s long-standing engagement
with the concepts of univocity and immanence
bears testament to this Spinozist commitment.
This is why, for Deleuze, concepts of life or
vital-ism, nature or pantheism, enter the
stage. For Deleuze, Spinoza’s panthe-ism is
not a philosophy of nature, much less a natural
philosophy: “It is in short a philosophical
concept of immanence, which insinuates itself
among the transcendent concepts of emanative
or creationist theology.” As Deleuze notes,
such a position brings with it a “philosophical
danger”: “pantheism or immanence—the
immanence of its expression in what ex-presses
itself, and of what is expressed in its
expression.” 94 The “danger” of which Deleuze
speaks is not just of a political sort,  though,
in the historical context of Spinoza, it is
certainly that too. Rather, the danger is also
philosophical, in the sense that the idea of a
pure, ex-pressive immanence—of each thing in
each thing, of all in all—brings with it a number
of fundamental problems. One of these has to do
with the problem of production, creation, and
invention. If immanence is pure immanence,
immanent to nothing but itself, then how can
immanence also be a ceaseless creation and
invention of the new? How can creativity emerge
out of what is already fully actual? We have seen
this problem-atic arise before, with Cusa’s
notions of complicatio  and explicatio , and 
with Duns Scotus’ proofs for the univocal
relation between Creator and creature. This
problem turns onto another one, which deals
more with the pe- culiar logic of pantheism. As
we’ve seen, sometimes the thought of pure
immanence will elicit a reactionary response
that reaffirms the transcen-dence of the
divine. Eriugena does this in his quandary over
the tension between the divine will and
necessity (the divine must, ontologically
speaking, fl  ow forth, but must also be
undetermined and without limit),  and Duns
Scotus does this in his repeated qualifi 
cations for the concept  of univocity (e.g.,
that univocity presupposes a basic hierarchy
between Creator and creature). Certainly,
from a modern vantage point, such a 
pulling-back can be regarded as symptomatic of
the religious climate 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    229
    </p></div><p>
    
 214 chapter four within which such thinkers
were working. But what is equally important  is
that such reactions may also be indicative of
the strictures of logic that underpin
philosophical discourse. As we’ve seen,
Eriugena’s own brand of pantheism arises from
the thought of something that is nowhere in
partic-ular and everywhere in general, a
dispersive concept of the divine that, at
certain points, becomes coextensive with
natura  itself. Similarly, in Duns  Scotus the
“triple primacy” of Creator in relation to
creature gives way to  a foregrounding of the
interrelation of the triple primary, and,
ultimately, its unity. Finally, with Cusa, the
supernatural and natural, divided though they
are (as absolute and contracted), are still, at
certain points, rendered as a fully immanent
continuum of enfolding ( complicatio ) and
unfolding  (explicatio ). Each of these
reactionary moments has, as its double, the
thought of  immanence-in-itself, immanence
taken to its logical conclusion. In Eri-ugena
this is a fully dispersive notion of immanence,
in which natura   and nihil  become one and the
same—fully creative, efflusive, outpour-
ing,  an d  y e t  “ n o thing . ”  In  Duns  Sco tus  this  is  th
e  p rima cy  o f  uni v ocal  relations—a radical
equality of all things, and yet differentiated
along the lines of Creator and created. And in
Cusa this is the thought of a “coinci-dence of 
opposites”—a continuum of supernatural and
natural, and yet an  asymmetry between
enfolding and unfolding. Hence, in all these
cases, the gesture of pulling-back masks the
thought of pure immanence, an im-manence that
is at once a fully actual fi  eld and yet
continually generat- ing, creating, and
inventing. At its limit, the thought of pure
immanence becomes tantamount to the thought of
contradiction itself. If, as Deleuze
provocatively suggests, pantheism is a
philosophical danger, it is because
pantheism—as the conjunction of immanence and
life—opens onto the thought of contradiction
itself . This takes a particular form in
Deleuze’s reading of Spinoza. While  Spinoza
does not offer any easy solution to the problems
raised by the idea of pure immanence, in
Deleuze’s reading he does perform a number of
important operations on the concept of
immanence. In Deleuze’s Expres-sionism in
Philosophy , we can identify three main
Spinozist operations: a  critique of the
subordination of immanence in
onto-theological discourse; the idea of the
common (“common nature,” “common notions”) as
sup-plying an ontological framework for
immanence; and a leveraging of the notion of
expression to question the priority of being
over life. Together, these three operations
reveal concepts that are central to Spinoza’s
own pantheism—immanence, the common, and
expression. We can briefl  y  consider these in
turn.

  dark pantheism 215 4.7.1 The Insubordination
of Immanence in Deleuze The concept of
immanence has a confl  icted history in
onto-theological  discourse. For Deleuze, it
is not simply that the concept of immanence is 
always opposed to transcendence, but that
immanence is consistently sub-ordinated in a
way that allows it to perform limited
functions. However, a notion of “pure
immanence” would not only imply an absolutely
superla-tive concept of immanence, but it
would also imply a renewed concept of life that
would itself be fully isomorphic with the
concept of immanence. Immanence would not
simply be static, spatialized, full being, and
life would not simply be that which is defi  ned by
the temporality of growth,  decay,
development, and change—the conjunction of
immanence and life would also require a
synthesis, whereby immanence is temporalized
as expressive, inventive, and creative, and
life is laterally dispersed across the
traditional boundaries of species and set. But
this requires a lot, for such a pantheism tends
to exclude noth- ing and encompass everything.
It is, in short, the philosophical danger of 
which Deleuze speaks in regard to Spinoza, and
this is refl  ected in De- leuze’s three
overarching ontological principles in
Expressionism in Phi- losophy : (i) Being is
affirmation (principle of generosity); (ii)
everything is  everywhere (principle of
relation); and (iii) all is One (principle of
univoc-ity). In Spinoza’s pantheism, Deleuze
fi  nds concepts that threaten to efface  (or
relativize, depending on one’s viewpoint)
basic ontological categories: if Being is pure
affirmation, then it is also pure excess, and
the concept of negation loses its meaning; if
everything is everywhere, then the
dis-tinction between object and relation,
actor and act, is likewise meaning-less; and if
all is One, then the interplay between the One,
the Many, and even the multiple ceases to be
relevant. Deleuze does not, we should note, go
this far—the Scholastic rigor of Spinoza and
his predecessors prevents pure relativism.
Nevertheless, for Deleuze, this thought of the
absolute coincidence of immanence and life is
the very “vertigo of philosophy.” How, then,
has immanence been subordinated in the history
of philos- ophy? How has the concept of
immanence historically been separated from
the concept of expressive, inventive life?
Deleuze suggests that there are three phases to
this history. The fi  rst is in terms of the
concept of partici- pation. This is a classical
mode, whose exemplar is Plato and Platonism. In
Plato, immanence is conceived of in terms of
participation, and this can have three
meanings: it can mean “to take part in,” which
implies a basic distinction between the
participator and the participated. Thus, a
part is immanent in relation to a whole of which
it is a part; it is the whole, part of 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    231
    </p></div><p>
    
 216 chapter four the whole, and an individual
part all at once. Participation can also mean 
“to imitate” in a conventional Platonic sense,
as when a chair produced by an artisan
participates in the abstract idea of a chair.
This, however, neces-sitates an external
concept of imitator or artisan (who is, in the
case of nature, God-as-Creator), so that all
instantiations of an idea are only par-tially
or imperfectly immanent in the idea. Finally,
participation can also have a demonic meaning,
in the Greek sense of daimon, in which one is a 
recipient of the infl  uences of a spiritual
entity. This necessitates a theory  of
mediation or representation, whereby the
immanence outside the sub- ject is mediately
immanent within the subject. Thus
“[p]articipation was understood, according
to these schemes, either materially, or
imitatively, or demonically.” 95 All of these
notions of immanence-as-participation are,
Deleuze ar- gues, on the side of the
participant, rather than the participated.
Imma-nence is only ever a derivative,
secondary manifestation of something
equivocal and inaccessible, something
transcendent. A shift occurs, for D e l e u z e ,  w i t
h  N e o p l a t o n i s m .  “ N e o p l a t o n i s t s  n o  l o n g e r  s t a r
t  f r o m  t h e  characteristics of what
participates . . . They try rather to discover
the in-ternal principle and movement that
grounds participation in the partici-pated as
such.” 96 The emphasis is not on the derivative,
secondary instan- tiation of immanence, but on
the processes by which such instantiations are
produced from a transcendent source. This
necessitates a concept of production that at
once accounts for the immanence of the source in
its products, while preserving the hierarchy
of relations between source and product. Some
thing—a divine source—must be conceived as
being everywhere—in its productions—while
also remaining a source. It must not be
absolutely transcendent, since there must be
some connection be-tween source and product,
but it also must not be absolutely immanent,
since it is the very hierarchy between source
and product that grounds the ontology. In
short, “[p]articipation is neither material,
nor imitative, nor demonic; it is emanative.”
97 In this second phase, immanence is
understood in not in terms of par- ticipation ,
but in terms of emanation . Here Neoplatonism is
the exemplar,  with Proclus and Plotinus as
Deleuze’s reference points. Emanation
entails a logic of generosity and gift.
“Emanation has in general a triadic form:
giver, given, and recipient. To participate is
always to participate through what is given.”
98 Whereas in the fi  rst phase—immanence as 
participation— the emphasis was on the
participant as derivative, here, with
immanence as emanation, the emphasis is on the
side of the participated. Neoplatonic
emanation inadvertently points to the
possibility of a pure immanence, in 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    232
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 217 that it focuses on the
processes rather than the products (e.g.,
articulations  of the stratifi  ed spheres of
emanation in Plotinus’ cosmology). But emana-
tion is still a subordinated immanence, since
it must preserve a notion of  the participated
that is above or beyond all things. This
emanative source itself remains
non-immanent: “Everything emanates from this
principle, its gives forth everything. But it
is not itself participated, for participation
occurs only through what it gives, and in what it
gives . . . only occurs through a principle that
is itself imparticipable.” 99 These fi  rst two
phases—immanence-as-participation,
immanence-as- emanation—have something in
common, however, and that is that they remain in
themselves in their production. The Idea or the
Source always remains in itself, either
because it is abstractly beyond all things of
which it is the perfected form, or because it is
processually above all things it emanatively
produces. “Their common characteristic is
that neither leaves itself: they produce while
remaining in themselves .” 100 There are a 
number of important differences, then,
between this partial immanence-as-emanation
and a notion of immanence taken in itself.
“While an ema-native cause remains in itself,
the effect it produces is not in it, and does not
remain in it.” 101 “A cause is immanent, on the
other hand, when its  effect is ‘immanante’ in
the cause, rather than emanating from it.”102
The  cause of emanation is outside of what it
gives or produces; whereas with immanence the
effect is immanent in the cause. In this way
Deleuze ar-ticulates one of his central
points: that the key to thinking immanence in
itself lies not in opposing it to
transcendence, but in its subordination to
“emanence” or emanation. This leads to a third
phase Deleuze considers, one in which imma-
nence is no longer subordinate to either
participation or emanation. And this is, in
Deleuze’s eyes, what Spinoza’s philosophy
provides—a concept of insubordinate
immanence whose real opposition is not between
tran-scendence and immanence, but between
immanence and emanence . How  does Spinoza’s
philosophy do this? How can immanence be
thought in it-self, without resorting to
either the necessity of an external Source (as
in Neoplatonic emanation) or to the necessity
of an abstract Idea (as in Pla-tonic
exemplarism)? As Deleuze suggests, one has to
understand Spinoza’s Scholasticism, and the
way that Spinoza takes up and transforms
Scholas-tic onto-theological concepts. It is
here that Deleuze turns to the Cusan terms of
complication ( complicatio ) and explication (
explicatio ): Such is the origin of a pair of
notions that take on greater and greater 
importance in the philosophies of the Middle
Ages and Renaissance:

 218 chapter four complicare  and explicare . All
things are present to God, who compli- cates
them. God is present to all things, which
explicate and implicate  him . . . Immanence
corresponds to the unity of complication and
ex-plication, of inherence and implication.
103 As we saw with Cusa, the processes of
complication and explication are  “folded”
onto the same, singular, divine nature; but
they are also asym-metrical, for while this is a
two-way street, the direction of complication
clearly bears the more authentic stamp of the
divine than the explication into the things of
the world. Deleuze suggests that Spinoza, in
his sub-stance monism, takes up these Cusan
terms and radicalizes them. In the Spinozist
framework, if one is to think immanence in
itself, one has to see the processes of
complication and explication are absolutely
equivalent: “A co-presence of two correlative
movements comes to be substituted for a series
of successive subordinate emanations . . . An
equality of being is substituted for a
hierarchy of hypostases; for things are
present to the same Being, which is itself
present in things.” 104 One of the requirements 
of thinking immanence in itself is, then,
thinking the processes of com- plicatio  and
explicatio  in terms of an absolute immanence.
This is the fi  rst move Deleuze makes in relation
to Spinoza’s   philosophy—linking the dynamic
processes of complication and explica- tion to
immanence. The second move Deleuze makes is to
then link im-manence to an inventive,
creative, and vitalist concept of expression:
Participation no longer has its principle in an
emanation whose source  lies in a more or less
distant One, but rather in the immediate and
adequate expression of an absol ute Being that
comprises in i t all be-ings, and is explicated
in the essence of each. Expression comprehends
all these aspects: complication,
explication, inherence, implication. And
these aspects of expression are also the
categories of immanence. Immanence is
revealed as expressive, and expression as
immanent, in a system of logical relations
within which the two notions are correlative.
105 Expression, insofar as it is a principle of
inventive, creative life, is here  indelibly
tied to the concept of immanence in
itself—“immanence is re-vealed as
expressive, and expression as immanent.”
Expression, though it implies a basic
temporal, causal dichotomy of expressor and
expressed, Creator and creature, producer and
produced—expression must take this dichotomy
and fl  atten it out in terms of immanence, such
that the expres-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    234
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 219 sor is not just “in” the
expressed but coincident with it as well.
Likewise,  immanence, though it implies a
static, fully actualized distribution, must
take this plenum  and render it dynamic and
processual, such that imma- nence is precisely
that which constantly invents and creates
nothing other  than immanence itself. For
Deleuze, this conjunction of immanence and
expression—or really,  of immanence and life
—has three fundamental principles,
principles that  push the limits of the concept
itself. First, the principle of equality :
“pure  immanence requires as a principle the
equality of being, or the positing of equal
Being: not only is being equal in itself, but it
is seen to be equally present in all beings.” 106
Immanence is not only the immanence between 
Creator and creature (a vertical immanence),
but the immanence between creature and
creature (a horizontal immanence)—what Cusa
calls “each thing in each thing.” There is also
the principle of univocity : “pure im- manence
requires a Being that is univocal and
constitutes a Nature, and that consists of
positive forms, common to producer and
product, to cause and effect.” 107 I m m a n e n c e ,  w
h i c h  h e r e  b e c o m e s  s y n o n y m o u s  w i t h  p a n - theism,
is at the same time dispersive and inventive,
distributive and cre-ative, supernatural and
natural. Finally, there is the principle of
affirma- tion: “[i]mmanence is opposed to any
eminence of the cause, any negative  theology,
any method of analogy, any hierarchical
conception of the world.  With immanence all is
affirmation.” 108 If there is to be a specifi 
cally Spi- nozist pantheism, Deleuze
articulates it along these three lines: a
purely immanent equality, in which the
supernatural is fully immanent to the natural,
and vice-versa; a univocity of all things that
implies a fully im-manent and vitalistic
continuum between one thing and another; and an
ontological affirmation that supports a
notion of being as purely superla-tive,
affirmative, and creative. Together, these
three principles of equality, univocity, and
affirmation constitute the pantheism unique
to Spinoza’s philosophy, where “pantheism”
implies the conjunction of immanence and life.
These are difficult concepts, to be sure, for in
actuality they stretch  the limits of the
concept itself. As Deleuze notes, “Immanence
is the very vertigo of philosophy, and is
inseparable from the concept of expression.”
109  But they also have a tactical function,
which is to critically question the concept of
immanence in itself. For Deleuze, this notion
of pantheism, this conjunction of immanence
and life, this has always been historically
op-posed to transcendence, and, more
importantly, subordinated to emanence or
emanation. There immanence continues to
function, but in a tempered, conciliatory way,
either in the Idea or the emanative Source. In
this way

 220 chapter four the “expressive immanence of
Being was grafted onto a transcendent ema-
nation of the One.”110 While Neoplatonic
emanation does open the door  to the exp lication
of the worl d from God, i t is still required to
preserve  the hierarchy of the divine Source.
While Medieval Scholasticism would push this
to its limits—either in the “inexpressible” of
negative theology, or the univocity of Creator
and creature—it is still required to preserve
the asymmetry between divination and
creation, complication and expli-cation. The
option left, the one Deleuze opts for, is to push
the concept of immanence to such a degree that it
effectively becomes “nothing”: The idea of
expression is repressed as soon as it surfaces.
For the themes  of creation or emanation cannot
do without a minimal transcendence, which bars
‘expressionism’ from proceeding all the way to
the imma-nence it implies . . . The signifi  cance
of Spinozism seems to me this:  it asserts
immanence as a principle and frees expression
from any sub-ordination to emanative or
exemplary causality. Expression itself no 
longer emanates, no longer resembles anything
. 111 In these pantheistic philosophies,
predicated as they are on the fullness of 
(dynamic) fl  ow and (static) being, an
inversion occurs, in which the end- point of
immanence is its own dissipation. For Deleuze,
it is with Spinoza,  drawing as he does from his
Scholastic predecessors, that we fi  rst
encoun- ter two thoughts central to an ontology
of life: the thought of immanence-in-itself,
and the conjunction of this
immanence-in-itself and expressive life,
that becomes the hallmark of a renewed
pantheism, an “expressive pantheism or
immanence.” 4.7.2 Scholia I: The Isomorphism 
of Univocity and Immanence Is there a signifi 
cant difference between the concepts of
univocity and  immanence in Deleuze? One
possible answer is diachronic, which would
involve comparing Deleuze’s early and later
readings of Spinoza. For ex-ample, earlier
works such as Difference and Repetition  favor
univocity, as  in Deleuze’s celebrated
assertion: “There has only ever been one
ontologi-cal proposition: Being is
univocal.” 112 By contrast, late pieces, such
as “Im- manence: A Life” favor the term
immanence. But this contrast does not bear
itself out, for, even in a single work Deleuze
will use both terms— sometimes differently,
and sometimes interchangeably. In
Expressionism  in Philosophy , Deleuze will
comment that in Spinoza, “the whole theory 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    236
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 221 of expression supports
univocity.” But he also points out that
expression  has to do with “a specifi  cally
philosophical concept of immanence.” The term
“univocity” is, as Deleuze notes, derived from
Scholastic  discourse, and in Deleuze’s
particular sense, from Duns Scotus. As we’ve 
seen in the previous chapter, the question of
whether the relation between God and Nature was
analogical, equivocal, or univocal was a
central point of debate in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, and Deleuze’s reading
of Duns Scotus pushes the concept of univocity
to a point where Duns Sco-tus himself arguably
would not, or could not, go. In Deleuze’s
Scholasticism, the relation between Creator
and creature  is a univocal relation. Being is
said the same everywhere that it is said. But the
essence of the divine is immanent with relation
to the earthly. Both concepts presuppose a
basic relation, one that is asymmetrical
(Creator-creature, divine-earthly,
supernatural-natural, etc.). But the
relation itself, emphasizing as it does a “fl 
at” or horizontal relation, collapses this
rela- tion into a single plane. Immanence, by
contrast, is far less common in Scholastic
discourse.  When one does fi  n d i t, i t is used in a N
eop la toni c an d deri v a ti v e w ay—  immanence is
always, as Deleuze notes, subordinated to the
theologico- political dictates of
transcendence. But even in these instances,
imma-nence seems to imply a more general state;
it tends towards the static. But even if it is
taken to be about the divine nature in itself,
this still presup-poses a minimal relation
(transcendent with respect to . . . , eminent
with respect to . . .). Immanence, in its stasis
or plenum , always harbors within  it a minimal
relation that implies a dunamis . Should we then
say that, in Deleuze’s Scholasticism,
univocity fore- grounds temporality, and
immanence spatiality? Or should we say that 
univocity is a special case of immanence?
Another possibility is that, for Deleuze,
immanence is “expressed” as univocity. But
then this would transform immanence into a
state of being that is then expressed, and
univocity becomes adverbial, the way in which
immanence is expressed (which then opens up the
question of whether immanence can be
ex-pressed equivocally or analogically . . .).
Hence, to say that univocity correlates to
temporality, and immanence  to spatiality,
doesn’t quite work out either, for immanence
and univoc-ity each have spatial and  temporal
aspects to them. They are spatially a 
spreading-out, a diffusion, a topology of
everything-is-everywhere. But t h e n  t h i s  o p e n
s  o n t o  t h e  K a n t i a n  ( a n d  v e r y  u n - D e l e u z i a n )  q u e s
t i o n  o f  whether there is a space—the being of
space—that itself serves as the sup-port for
immanence/univocity. Does immanence, for
instance, need a con-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    237
    </p></div><p>
    
 222 chapter four tainer within which to be
immanent? Is immanence always immanent to  some
space? Likewise, immanence/univocity are
temporally a denial of external  causes (the
causality of transcendence or emanence).
Immanence is self- caused, or, as we might say
today, self-organized. Immanent being
pro-duces itself, in itself, through itself.
There is no external causal agency. But then
this opens onto the question of whether there
can be said to be causation at all, for does not
the very notion of cause presuppose a minimal
distinction between subject and object, a
correlation of self and world? Another
possibility: should we modify our terms, and
say that, in De- leuze’s Scholasticism,
univocity emphasizes relationality, while
imma-nence emphasizes continuity? We would be
led to consider to concepts that are
essentially two sides of the same page. But this
only exacerbates the problem, for it requires a
third term. Is this the function that
“expres-sion” plays in Deleuze’s reading of
Scholasticism? When we have expres-sive
univocity, we have the emphasis of the
ontological priority of dynamic relation and
interrelation—but relations and
interrelations that open onto a fl at
continuum. When we have expressive immanence,
we have the em- phasis on the ontological
priority of dispersive, pervasive being—but a
dis-persiveness and a pervasiveness that open
onto a network of relations. It is debatable
whether or not expression actually plays this
role in De- leuze’s Scholasticism, without
assigning expression the role of a mediator or
an act, and the paired terms
univocity/immanence as things. This is why
Deleuze’s main adversary in Expressionism in
Philosophy is Plotinus  and not Plato. The
Plontinean system attempts to have it both
ways—to posit a divine Source that is
equivocally transcendent, and to posit an
equally divine emanation that is univocally
present in all created things. What remains
relevant in Deleuze’s usage of the terms
univocity and im-manence is his concerted
attempt to think a dynamic, relational concept
of immanence, as well as a fully distributive,
pervasive concept of univoc-ity. Perhaps,
then, Deleuze’s philosophy does not amount to
an attempt to “invert Platonism,” but rather an
attempt to “subvert Neoplatonism”—that is, to
think a concept of emanation without a center .
4.7.3 Scholia II: The Vitalist Logic of Common
Notions In the Opus Oxoniense  D u n s  S c o t u s  b r i e
fl  y raises the possibility that  the univocal
relation between God and Nature could be made
possible by something common to them both:
“[S]uppose we say that A through its 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    238
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 223 own essence knows B because
of the great similarity between the two, so  that
A knows B through some nature common ( speciei
communis ) to A  and B.”113 The question that Duns
Scotus puts forth is whether, supposing  that
God and Nature are univocal, a “natural”
knowledge of this univoc- ity could be
possible. To the reply that answers in the
negative—that the univocity of God and Nature
can be known only via faith—Duns Scotus argues
that univocity can be thought, and that,
furthermore, “natural rea-son” can provide
the proofs for such a univocal relation. Hence
the proof above concerning the “common
nature.” This, however, does not prove that A
knows B perfectly—that is, univocally— nor
that because of this  A is God, in the sense of
being absolutely equivocal. It only
establishes a likeness, but does not say if this
likeness is univocal. The idea of the com-mon
nature fades away as quickly as it is evoked by
Duns Scotus. The idea of the common nature is not
only that which is common or  held univocally,
but that which is held univocally in a
non-divine way, in-sofar as the divine is
separate from nature. The idea is picked up
later by Spinoza, but in terms of “common
notions” rather than a common nature. What are
common notions? Deleuze provides a number of
defi  nitions. In a  formal sense, “[a] common
notion is always an idea of similarity of
com-position in existing modes.” 114 The
relation between any two bodies (that  is,
between any two relations) reveals, at a more
general level, a whole of which they are a part.
This is their “common property,” their
“similar-ity or community of composition.”
Amid this whole is Nature, a “com-mon notion.”
“As all relations are combined in Nature as a
whole, Nature presents a similarity of
composition that may be seen in all bodies from
the most general viewpoint.” 115 The
implication is that only the relations  change
in Nature as a whole, not the constituent parts.
Nature is thus both fully actual (in that the
parts do not change) but also inherently
virtual (in that the relations combine infi 
nitely). From the point of view of Spinozist 
modes, there are less universal common
notions, but there are also more universal
common notions that are common to all things
(e.g., extension). Deleuze distinguishes
common notions as particular kinds of terms. 
Common notions are not transcendental terms
(the being of a thing,  Being-in-itself); they
are not universal terms (genera, species); and
they are  not abstract ideas (insofar as the
latter retains only sensible differences or
are based on accidental and arbitrary
criteria). Common notions have to do with what
Deleuze calls “structures” rather than
sensible forms or func-tions. And it is here
that Deleuze puts forth one of his many
criticisms of “life” in the Aristotelian
sense:
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    239
    </p></div><p>
    
 224 chapter four In all this Spinoza is clearly
attacking, not just the procedures of com- mon
sense, but the Aristotelian tradition also.
The attempt to defi  ne  genera and species
through differences fi  rst appears in
Aristotelian bi- ology . . . Against this
tradition Spinoza proposes a grand principle:
to consider structures, rather than sensible
forms or functions. But what is the meaning of
‘structure’? It is a system of relations
between the parts of a body . . . By inquiring how
these relations vary from one body to another,
we have a way of directly determining the
resemblances between two bodies, however
disparate they may be . . . In the limit Nature as a
whole is a single Animal [ un même Animal ] in
which only  the relations between the parts
vary. 116 In other works, Deleuze will use the
philosophy of biology to make a simi- lar
point—whereas Cuvier will propose a
comparative anatomy based on sensible
similarities and functions, Geoffroy
Saint-Hilaire will propose a single manifold
plane along which each animal is isomorphic
with every other animal. 117 What Spinoza puts
forth is an even wider view of living  Nature,
within which a single substance courses
through and yet is insep-arable from the modes
that constitute the world. If Spinoza is a
pantheist thinker, this is not because the
divine is everywhere “in” nature; it is
be-cause the immanence of nature in and through
itself necessitates an onto-logical
framework that departs from Aristotelian
natural philosophy: “For the examination of
sensible differences is substituted an
examination of intelligible similarities,
which allow us to understand resemblances and
differences between bodies ‘from the
inside.’” 118 It is for this reason that
Deleuze, in a suggestive turn of phrase, notes 
that common notions are really “biological
ideas” or really, an ideational  biology :
“Spinoza’s common notions are biological,
rather than physical or  mathematical, ideas.
They really do play the part of Ideas in a
philosophy of Nature from which all fi  nality
has been excluded.” 119 Common notions  are
biological ideas in the sense that they do not
presuppose the separation of organism and
environment; they are based on an idea of Nature
without teleology or fi  nality; and they posit a
notion of life that is nonorganic, in  which the
organism is an effect and not a cause. Deleuze is
careful to note, however, that the common
notions are “bio- logical” not in the sense of
the philosophy of biology—which, as a mod-ern
phenomenon, necessarily begins from an
assumption about the ontol-ogy of life.
Rather, common notions are biological in the
sense of Idealist  philosophy—or better, in the
sense in which all philosophies of nature are 
“idealist.” They are not idealist in the vulgar
sense of being imaginary

sense of German Lebensphilosophie , in which
everything, including  thought, is understood
to be exterior to the subject. There is no
question  of nature being imaginary or
perfectly malleable to intentional thought,
for all thought is already given in a manner that
is relational, exterior, and pervasive to
individuated bodies and minds. Spinoza’s
pantheism is thus not only anti-Aristotelian,
but anti-Cartesian as well. What
metaphysi-cally grounds any philosophy of
nature is the anti-metaphysical sense of that
which is common to all things, not in spite of but
because of their manifold differentiations
and interrelations. What grounds Spinoza’s
pan-theism is neither Aristotelian fi  nality
or entelechism, nor the Neoplatonic  emanating
Source, but the relations immanent to each
other that consti-tute “God or Nature.” In
Deleuze’s reading of Spinoza, any philosophy
of nature necessarily entails a pantheism, but
a pantheism that is commen-surate with
“idealism.” 4.7.4 Scholia III: The Life of
Substance One of Deleuze’s strongest claims
concerning the ontology of life comes in the
chapter of Expressionism in Philosophy  on
attributes and the abso- lute. There, in a
somewhat anomalous turn of phrase, Deleuze
stridently makes a claim for “the life of
substance itself”: “Life, that is,
expressivity, is carried into the absolute.
There is a unity of the divine in substance, and
an actual diversity of the One in the attributes
. . . it amounts to the life of substance itself,
the necessity of its apriori constitution.”
120 What exactly is the “life of substance”? It
is not just that such-and-such  a phenomenon is
alive, in the sense of “nonorganic life,” but
rather that substance itself is alive. Why
then, does Deleuze feel the need to make a claim
beyond substance itself, to say that not only is
substance absolutely infi nite, but that it is
alive as well? Spinoza, in the Ethics , never
makes reference to “life” and only occa-
sionally to nature in its modern, biologistic
sense. One might guess that, given Spinoza’s
metaphysical framework, life would be
somewhere be-tween an attribute (inasmuch as
life is a combination of thought and
exten-sion) and a mode (actual living
creatures as opposed to a principle of life).
The phrase “the life of substance” asks us to
consider an  anachronism—a  biological
Spinozism. Is “the life of substance”
something other than sub-stance itself? Is it
something external to substance? Is it a
meta-substance, a super-substance? Is there a
nonliving substance, or is the greater
contra-diction to suppose that substance is
living?
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    241
    </p></div><p>
    
 226 chapter four Deleuze seems to take it for
granted that Spinoza is a pantheist. But  there
are, of course, variants of pantheism, each
responding to a particular  set of
philosophical and theological problems.
There is the Neoplatonic version (often
described as panentheism), in which nature
participates “in” the divine. Here all that
which changes (nature) is coupled with that
which does not change (the divine) by the former
being included within the latter (the latter
transcendentally including the immanence of
the former). A slight modifi  cation of this is
found in Eriugena’s Periphyseon ,  which at some
points affirms the transcendental aspect
(e.g., God as that  which creates and is not
created), and at other points seems to affirm a
more immanent aspect (e.g., that which neither
creates nor is created as God and nature). The
Spinozist version—as Deleuze reads it—goes
further and pushes  for absolute immanence. In
this type of pantheism, nature equals the
di-vine and vice-versa. Deus sive Natura , in
Spinoza’s celebrated phrase. So  the phrase
“the life of substance” refers to this
equivalence between Na-ture and God, life and
the divine. This Spinozist pantheism implies
not only an immanence of the divine (one
substance for all attributes), but also an
immanence of life: if God is Nature, and Nature
is all living be-ings, then God is all living
beings. Again, Deleuze’s phraseology is very
particular—he does not make life  a character of
substance (e.g., “substance is alive”), but
implies that there is something beyond
substance of which substance is the expressed;
it al-most implies that life courses through
substance, makes it alive, perhaps even
“ensouls” it. It would then appear that Deleuze
grants life a kind of supereminence—if it is not
simply another metaphysical category,
neither is it reducible to regional
philosophies, such as natural philosophy or
the philosophy of biology. It is not that life is
a category of being (as Heidegger would have
it), but rather that being, or the being of
being, is a subset of a higher form of life. This
life is not simply the life of the organism, but
nei-ther is it the energetic life of vitalism,
or the divine life of pantheism. Nevertheless,
there is something about modality—about
change, pro- cess, becoming, and so on—that
persists through Deleuze’s many variants of
this theme of the “life of substance.” This is a
modality of affirmation that one fi  nds in so
many of Deleuze’s works. Only by assuming a
notion  of being as generosity can Deleuze grant
being a higher form-of-life. Be-ing is alive
because there is always an exterior (though not
an outside), because there is always the
virtual (though not the potential), because
life, for Deleuze, is always in excess of being
—including its own being. Now, philosophers
such as Badiou have taken Deleuze to task for
this

  dark pantheism 227 vitalism, for, in such
readings, it simply masks a theological
position, or  at the very least a romanticized
notion of Nature.121 Instead of the affir-
mative, additive approach of Deleuze, Badiou,
for instance, will opt for a  negative,
“subtractive” ontology based on mathematics.
Here the ground of being is not a superlative
principle of generosity, but a subtractive
ges-ture; not the overfl  owing fl  ux, but the
empty set, the void. But Deleuze’s  reworking of
the concept of life—and with it, the concepts
that ground biology and the philosophy of
nature—entails, as we’ve seen, a critique of
the Aristotelian framework of the “biological
set” (genera, species, types; natural history
and comparative anatomy). Hence Deleuze’s
frequent as-sociations between an ontology of
pure immanence and an ontology of life—the life
of substance: It [the concept of immanence in
Spinoza] gives back to Nature its own  specifi  c
depth and renders man capable of penetrating
into this depth.  It makes man commensurate with
God, and puts him in possession of a new logic:
makes him a spiritual automaton [ automate
spirituel ]  equal to a combinatorial world.
Born of the traditions of emanation and
creation it makes of these two enemies,
questioning the transcen-dence of a One above
Being along with the transcendence of a Being
above his Creation. 122 The “spiritual
automaton” is not, of course, mechanism
elevated to the  Platonic level of thought; it
is, for Deleuze, that point at which “life” and
“thought” coincide in a sort of vitalist logic
of proliferation and combina-torics. Such a
notion requires the presupposition of an
ontology of life in which life exceeds being.
The question, then, is whether this ontology of
life as the One-All bears any relation
whatsoever to the Aristotelian ontol-ogy from
which Deleuze’s philosophy distances itself.
One way in which Deleuze does this is to focus on a
principle of generosity and superlative
excess as the ontological principle coursing
through life. Purely affirma-tive, always
changing, always transforming, totally
immanent to itself—this is Deleuze’s own
pantheism, infl  ected as it is through the
Scholasti- cism of Spinoza. More questions
emerge. Does this require that there be
something that  is “not-life”? If so, would this
not-life also serve as the ground of the “life of
substance”? And what would this ground be, but
itself the pure imma-nence of which Deleuze
speaks? We can ask another question, one that
recapitulates a theme running through many of
the thinkers we’ve en-countered thus far: if
Deleuze’s ontology of life has little or
nothing to do

 228 chapter four with its Aristotelian
version, is it possible that what life is for
Deleuze is  precisely void, nothing, and nihil ?
In other words, is it precisely the void  that is
the immanent ground for “the life of
substance”? 4.8 DARK PANTHEISM A number of the
thinkers we’ve been dealing with have put forth
ideas  that have been called pantheist, either
at the time of their writing or post-humously.
Generally, the idea that the supernatural and
the natural, or God and Nature, are one and the
same, tends to fl  atten and disperse any 
conceptual framework of transcendence or
centralization. In its radical v ari an t ,  p an t h
e i s m  e v e n  d o e s  a w a y  w i t h  t h e  c o n c ili a t o ry ,  d e c e
n t r aliz e d  position of emanence or emanation.
Such an idea brings with it obvious
politico-theological dangers—any pantheist
outlook essentially does away with all of
Aquinas’ fi  ve proofs for the existence of God,
and by extension,  the necessity of the power
relationships internal to religious
governance. Pantheism is thus heretical in the
theological sense that it does away with the
necessity of all mediation, be it in the form of
Neoplatonic exemplar-ism, Patristic
interpretations of the Trinity, or Thomist
analogy. It is also heretical in the political
sense in that, by conceiving of hierarchical
me-diation as unnecessary, pantheism
implicitly questions the doctrinally infl
ected stratifi  cations inherent within
institutional structures such as  University.
But, as Deleuze notes, pantheism also brings
with it another type of  danger, one of a
philosophical type. For in doing away with the
stratifi  ca- tions of the supernatural and
natural, pantheism also does away with the
stratifi  cations between human, animal, and
divine. In modern parlance,  pantheism raises
the question of life as a fundamentally unhuman 
phe- nomenon. Pantheism in Deleuze’s sense
points to a horizon in which both “life” and
“thought” can be understood in
non-anthropomorphic ways. It is not that each
individual person is divine; rather, the
divine is under-stood to be indissociable from
nature, and because of this, radically
unhu-man, anonymous, and neutral. This
pantheism is certainly far from the pantheon of
Greek divinities, where human drama is
displayed at a meta-level, as it were. But
heretical pantheism is also markedly
different from the notion of the divine in
Medieval Christendom, where the divine is fi
gured as an anthropomorphized, sovereign
deity who is by turns puni- tive and merciful,
generous and silent to all prayers. It would be
tempting to suggest that the difference
between pantheism and the anthropomor-phized
deity correlates to the difference between
philosophy and theol-

  dark pantheism 229 ogy, the latter always
compromised by the dictates of religious
doctrine.  But this would be inaccurate, for
despite the modern, radical readings of
Spinoza by authors such as Alexandre Matheron,
Antonio Negri, Étienne Balibar, Warren
Montag, and Deleuze, Spinoza’s texts
themselves show an immediate awareness of the
difficulty of separating philosophy and
theol-ogy. This ambiguity is also refl  ected in
Scholastic thinkers such as Duns  Scotus, as
well as the speculative mystics such as Cusa. If
the boundary between theology and philosophy
is a moving target,  then in pantheism so is the
boundary between fi  rst philosophy and the 
philosophy of nature. In heretical pantheism,
the divine is not human in  the sense that the
human is both derived from and a derivative form
of the divine; rather, the human is unhumanized
precisely because it is divine, in the sense
that the divine is separable from nature,
nature conceived of as a pure immanence.
Heretical pantheism not only threatens to do
away with the separation between the human and
the divine, but it also threatens to do away with
the separation between the supernatural and
the natural. Hence Deleuze’s striking
formulation of the divine nature as “a single
An-imal.” The “heretical” pantheism promoted
by Deleuze asks us to think of a concept of pure
immanence and a concept of dynamic, inventive
life in one and the same thought. Something that
is everywhere and at all times, but always
differently. But this also implies a
“something” that, since it is everywhere at all
times differently, is also not-something, a
“nothing.” And yet this
nothing-that-is-everywhere is constantly
differentiating, a nothing that is also a
superlative excess and affirmation. Perhaps
we can say that the pantheism of which we are
speaking is a  particular kind of pantheism, one
opposed to the theological pantheism (or
really, panentheism), for which an
anthropomorphic God still serves as sovereign
Creator and Source. There the transcendent God
still sneaks in through the side door. But the
pantheism we’ve been discussing is also
opposed to a more modern, affectivist,
“hippie” pantheism, for which the world still
exists for the human, in a kind of benevolent fl 
ux and fl  ow. In  this sense, the limit to the
thought of nature in the pantheist sense is the
thought of extinction, the disaster, the
limit-thought of life “after life.” That is,
pantheism in this sense thinks both life and
negation in the same thought; it is poised
against the presumptions of
life-as-generosity, as gift, as givenness. If
pantheism does involve the thought of pure
immanence, t h e n  t h i s  t h o u g h t  w i l l  b e  e q u a l l y  m i
s a n t h r o p i c  a s  w e l l  a s  s i m p l y  n o n -
anthropomorphic. For this reason, the
pantheism which we’ve been refer- ring to as
heretical might better be called dark
pantheism . Dark panthe- ism puts forth  the
challenge of thinking, under the sign of the
negative,

 230 chapter four the conjunction of pure
immanence and inventive life —with the caveat 
that this thought itself is thought as
fundamentally exterior to all anthro-
pomorphism. We would be tempted to call this
“misanthropology”—and in this sense,
pantheism as the conjunction of immanence and
life is also the horizon of thought itself. 123
The question of dark pantheism is, then, a
question about “life,” inso- far as it is
irreducible to any biologistic substrate, is
also a question about  thought. The thought of
life—or rather, the limit of the thought of
life—is a central preoccupation of this kind of
dark pantheism. It is latent in early mystical
works such as those by the Pseudo-Dionysius. It
also surfaces, in a more
Neoplatonic-Aristotelian manner, in
Eriugena’s Periphyseon , in  Duns Scotus’
comments on univocity in the Oxford and Paris
works, and in Cusa’s speculative mysticism.
Thus when Spinoza, in the Ethics , puts  forth his
substance monism and states, almost
matter-of-factly, “God or Nature,” we should
see an entire genealogy of dark pantheism
behind such propositions. And neither should
Spinoza’s pantheism be regarded as the end of
this  genealogy , for, after Spinoza, it is not by
any means sublimated into the nascent
scientifi  c fi elds that would become natural
history and biology. In  fact, one could
arguably extend this genealogy of dark
pantheism into the  biological era, including
the complex interactions between idealism and
a philosophy of life in German philosophy
(Schelling’s Naturphilosophie ,  Novalis, the
early Hegel, the Lebensphilosophie 
tradition), as well as the  nineteenth-century
diversions from Darwinism (Schopenhauer’s
“east- ern” concept of nihil , Nietzsche’s
“divine sickness” . . .). The assertion of
pantheism, even of this type of dark pantheism,
brings  with it a number of fundamental
philosophical dilemmas. Insofar as
pan-theism implies a conjunction of immanence
and life, it is also an attempt to ontologize
life beyond its physico-biological
reduction. But this antire-ductionism brings
with it the problem of how to then articulate the
non-reductive, without subsuming it within
another, possibly more reductive concept.
Traditionally, this issue has plagued
philosophies of life, be they vitalist,
animist, or pantheist in fl  avor.
Historically, the many debates in  the
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
surrounding vitalism (pitting vi-talists
against mechanists, epigeneticists against
preformationists, and so on) revolved around
the issue of reductionism: could the life
processes in the organism be reduced to their
material and/or deterministic properties? If
not, would one then be required to posit a
nonempirical, immaterial, even spiritual
life-force that grounds the properties
specifi  c to living ver- sus nonliving nature?
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    246
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 231 However, such debates are
often overdetermined—the issue becomes  a
zero-sum game in which a challenge is put forth,
to explicate such-and- such a natural
phenomenon. The question such a game puts forth
is, “ can  this or that phenomenon of life be
reduced to the laws of mechanism, or  the
properties of chemistry?” But reductionism
works in two directions; in the other direction
it is sometimes called “abstraction.” This
reverse question is rarely posed—or if it is, it
is posed within the context of theol-ogy. The
reverse question would be something like, “is
it possible to ab-stract this or that
phenomenon of life without
life-in-the-abstract simply becoming a
question of God?” In the genealogy of dark
pantheism that we’ve been tracing—from Eri-
ugena, to Duns Scotus, to Cusa, and to
Spinoza—there is another prob-lematic aside
from that of reductionism, and it is that of
abstraction. The challenge, then, is not in
giving an account of the level of temporality
(be-coming, change, process), or of the level
of causality (morphology, nonlin-earity),
but in giving an account of that which is
nonreductive. The chal-lenge for dark
pantheism is in giving an account of the
transcendental in its relation to the purely
immanent. This is encapsulated by Alain Badiou
in his reading of Deleuze’s “vitalist” notion
of the event: [I]n restraining the thought of
change to the vitalist simplicity of the  One,
though by taking the (classical) precaution of
thinking the One as the power of
differenciation—all like the Stoics,
Spinoza, Nietzsche or Bergson before
him—Deleuze cannot really succeed at
accounting for the transcendental  change of
worlds. It remains impossible to sub- mit such a
type of change to the sign of Life, whether one
renames it Power, Élan , or Immanence. It is
necessary to think discontinuity as it  is,
without being reabsorbed in any creative
univocity, however indis- tinct or chaotic
this concept be. 124 For Badiou, the
ontologizing of Life in terms of time,
temporality, and the  event only begs the
question of how to then ontologize that which
tran-scends any single or singular event. This
was precisely the question that Duns Scotus
grappled with in his notion of the univocity of
the divine, and it is on this point that Cusa
struggles to fi  nd a common ground be- tween the
contracted and absolute Maximum. What this
means is that any ontology of life has to
confront not just  the challenge of
reductionism, but it must also deal with the
difficulty of articulating the
transcendent—especially when, in dark
pantheism, the ontology of life is indelibly
wrapped up with a notion of pure immanence. 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    247
    </p></div><p>
    
 232 chapter four On the one hand, any ontology of
life must avoid the objectifi  cation of life, 
life as thing, life as property, life as—in the
modern, biological sense—a  set of descriptors
that are possessed by things that, in
possessing them, are said to be living. But on
the other hand, an ontology of life must also
avoid the relativism of a purely ideational
abstraction of life, such that life becomes
equivalent to the subjective experience of
being alive—a position that not only
forecloses any real understanding of the
relationality of self and world, but which also
defi  nes life in terms of the human-subjective 
categories of experience. There are actually
two axes of contradiction in  this regard: an
axis of dynamic-static ; that is, a vitalist
principle of change,  becoming,
proliferation, and excess, and a principle of
distribution, perva-siveness,
spreading-out, and fullness. There is also an
axis of affirmation- negation ; that is, that
which is living immanence precisely because it
is a  superlative negation, a kind of vitalist
subtraction, the noumenal assertion  of that
which is nihil . These are the two axes along
which dark pantheism  attempts to think the
conjunction of immanence and life. Life is not
im-manent because of its pure fecundity or
generosity, its boundless creation or
invention; rather, life is equivalent to
immanence because it is, in itself, a nonbeing
that pervades its own axes of contradiction. D a
r k  p a n t h e i s m ,  a s  w e ’ v e  s e e n  h e r e  i n  t h e  w o r k  o f  E r
i u g e n a ,  D u n s   Scotus, and Cusa, involves two
main transitions in its thinking. There is a fi 
rst transition, from the coincidence of
opposites (Cusa) to the coex- istence of
contradiction (Spinoza). Life and immanence
shift from having separate and contradictory
coexistence, mediated by the processes of
com-plication and explication, to the real
coexistence of life and immanence in a single
contradiction (continually inventive and
fully actual, funda-mentally dynamic and a
priori fully distributed). We move further
away from the imperatives of synthesis here,
either in the form of a mystical sublimation
(Cusa’s Absolute Maximum) or in the form of a
modal os-cillation ( complicatio  and
explicatio , expression in attributes and
modes).  This coexistence of contradiction
works against the higher synthesis of
opposites, but it also works against the
Augustinian notion of the infi  - nite divine
(the divine as positively arrived at by
removing the qualifi  ers  of “this”). The
coexistence of contradiction—which is only
hinted at in Cusa and formally developed in
Spinoza—is not about resolution or even
tension. It is, instead, about how the thought
of life entails a thought of
contradiction—and, further , how this though t
possibly requires an affir -mation of
contradiction in itself. There is also a second
transition in dark pantheism, one that moves 
from the encompassing of all things (the One as
All), to the immanence 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    248
    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 233 of all things and nothing
(the All as nihil ). Once one thinks the coexis-
tence of contradiction, one also has to
entertain the affirmation of that 
contradiction in itself. This entails a shift
in pantheist, or indeed, monist thinking.
Traditional monist ontologies identify a One
that is immanently equal to the All (“one
substance for all attributes,” a single “Life”
that cuts through all material-energetic
orders), but in so doing they also fracture
immanence from within by separating a
principle of immanence from that within which
it is immanent. This is, as we’ve seen,
Deleuze’s critique of the conciliatory
immanence of Neoplatonism—though the
argument can just as easily be applied to
Deleuze’s own ontology of immanence as well. A
shift from the One-All dyad to an All-Nothing
introconversion (where All ↔ Nothing) is also a
shift from a One that is everywhere “in” the  All,
to an already immanent All whose immanence
implies that it is also Nothing. Spinoza’s
pantheism does not imply the bountifulness of
the di-vine, but rather that God/Nature are at
once All and Nothing; insofar as this is a
monism, it is, perhaps, a subtractive monism.
What enables the plentitude is precisely the
void. By way of closing, let us enumerate
several propositions concerning dark 
pantheism. These propositions are less
resolutions of the problems out-lined
earlier, and more questions concerning the
extent to which any on-tology of life also
implies a concept of its absolute, though
superlative, negation, where life becomes
nihil . These propositions can also be read as 
notes on method, ways of reading texts that
have, in many ways, become  irrevocably distant
from our present condition: • There is
God/Being in itself , and this God/Being is, in
itself, in- accessible. This follows from our
propositions in the chapter on  “superlative
life.” The divine nature is, in itself,
inaccessible to human understanding (cf. the
Pseudo-Dionysius, Eriugena, and Cusa). Thus
God/Being is therefore equivocal, or an
“equivocal in-existence,” and God/Being is
therefore inaccessible, or the “divine
inaccessible.” • There is also God/Being for
itself . God/Being is not only in itself,  but
also in others. The divine nature is also its own
negation (cf. Eriugena, Duns Scotus). Thus
God/Being is univocal, or the “uni-vocal
creature,” and God/Being is also immanence, or
a kind of pure or pathological immanence. •
“Life” is the point at which equivocity is
introconvertible with  univocity (cf. Duns
Scotus, Spinoza). Hence univocity (“all rela-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    249
    </p></div><p>
    
 234 chapter four tion”) is isomorphic with
equivocity (“no relation”). This is the “in-
troconversion of relation.” This
introconversion is poised against Thomist
analogy, which puts forth a kind of vitalist
correlation. • This leads to a question: What
happens when the equivocal  notion  of the divine 
is layered onto the univocal  notion of nature ?
One the  one hand, there is a subordinate or
conciliatory immanence (ema-nence,
eminence, panentheism). Here the divine is
accessible, as expressed in nature, but
remains separate from it. The Creator re-mains
beyond the creature while persisting within
it. On the other hand, there is also a pure
immanence (immanence in itself and not in
another). Here the divine is fully expressed in
nature and is not separate from it; Creator,
creature, and creation exist univocally along
a continuum. However, even this pure immanence
is still based on a notion of
life-as-generosity, and it is this premise
that, for instance, informs the
early-twentieth-century vitalist
ontolo-gies of Bergson, Whitehead, and even
Chardin. • If this is the case, one would then
have to consider a number of con- junctions,
such as equivocal inexistence + the univocal
creature,  or the divine inaccessible + dark
immanence. One of the upshots  o f  thi s  i s  tha t  Lif
e ,  as  o n t o l o giz e d  in  t e rm s  o f  Go d /Be ing,  i s  th e 
immanence of nothing. If God/Being/Life is
inaccessible, equivo-cal, inexistence, and
if the relation between Creator/creature,
Life/ l i v i n g  i s  u n i v o c a l  o r  i m m a n e n t ,  t h e n  G o d /
B e i n g / L i f e  i s  t h e  i m -manence of  nihil , a
pantheism of the void, a plane of the neutral. 
Insofar as Life is ontologized in terms of
generosity, the generosity of Life is nihil . •
Dark pantheism would be, taken broadly, the
thought of the conjunc- tion of immanence and
life, under the sign of the negative. And the
question this poses would be, quite simply:
does life = generosity =  nihil ? 4.9 ELLIPSES:
WANG YANGMING  AND IDEALIST NATURALISM In the
broad context of post-Aristotelian
Scholasticism, the relation be- tween Life and
the living put forth in the De Anima  is taken up in
a vari- ety of ways. While mystical philosophy
and negative theology address the relation
between Life and the living in terms of
generosity and the superla-tive, the period of
high Scholasticism addresses the Life-living
relation in terms of causality, creation, and
production. In this section we’ve seen a

  dark pantheism 235 third facet of the
Aristotelian ontology of Life and the living,
and that is  the discourse on the divine nature
itself, as it stretches from Eriugena to Cusa
and fi  nally Spinoza. However, the real tension
is not simply that be- tween
life-as-transcendence and
life-as-immanence, but a tension between  two
topologies: that of emanence or emanation, and
that of immanence or immanation. To assert the
latter is, in the context of Scholasticism, to
assert pantheism. But if one is to attempt to
think life in terms of imma-nence, then is this
akin to thinking about emanation without a
center? The problem is that once one considers
something like life-in-itself,  whether this
is a life-principle (as in Aristotle’s psukhe
¯) or as an inacces- sible fi  rst principle (as in
Eriugena’s natura ), one must also effectively
dis- sociate Life from the living. This is a
problem because, even though Ar-istotle’s
framework leads to contradiction, the
contradiction is clear: Life is that which
renders intelligible the living, but which in
itself cannot be thought, has no existence, is
not itself living. In a way, the discourse on the
divine nature and pantheism is an extended
thought experiment: how to think Life without
the mediation of the living. Later
philosophers such as Kant would recast this
dilemma in terms of an antinomy: every
asser-tion about life as inherently ordered,
organized, or purposeful, is always
undermined by the assertion itself and its
irrevocable object of thought. Already in the
Scholastic discourse of pantheism one detects
the Kantian antinomy, and the question of
whether every naturalist philosophy is
re-ally an idealist philosophy. Chinese
philosophy—taken in the broadest
sense—offers a rich reser- voir of thinking
about these problems of nature and life. Though
com-monly discussed in terms of its moral and
ethical philosophy, it is equally a refl  ection
on “the nature of things” and the self-world
relation. In fact,  for many of the canonical
thinkers, such as Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu),
ethi-cal philosophy cannot be separated from
natural philosophy. Of particu-lar interest
are two thinkers, Zhuxi (Chu Hsi) and Wang
Yangming (Wang Shou-Jen), the former active
during the twelfth century, the latter during
the late fi  fteenth century. Both thinkers are
often referred to as emblem- atic of the type of
Neo-Confucian thinking that combined ethical
max-ims with refl  ections on nature and
cosmology. However, they are also two  very
different, and even opposing, thinkers, and
part of their philosophical differences lies
on this question of naturalism vs. idealism.
125 Zhuxi’s philosophy is an inquiry into the
“nature of things,” with a  strong emphasis on
logical coherence and unity. The ability to
articulate an ethical philosophy even rests on
this ability to discern the nature of things. In
this endeavor, Zhuxi takes up the concept of
material-energetic

 236 chapter four force, or qi (ch’i), and
contrasts this to an ideational principle, or
li. On the  surface, li appears to be a
quasi-Platonic Idea, and qi appears to be a
quasi- Aristotelian psukhe ¯. But this
division doesn’t exactly work. For Zhuxi,  li is
an ontological principle, but it also an
undifferentiated, unchanging  unity.
Nevertheless, this undifferentiated unity is
also manifested in the  discrete things in the
world. Each thing thus expresses li totally, as
undif- ferentiated and unchanging. The
passage from li in itself to its expression  in
the nature of things is accomplished by qi .
There are, then, two planes  of immanence for
Zhuxi—that of li  understood in itself, and that
of li as  manifested via qi  and expressed in and
across the nature of things. This  twofold
notion of li is a cosmological principle—that
is, it supersedes the  theological principle of
the earthly and the divine: “Fundamentally,
prin- ciple [ li] cannot be interpreted in the
senses of existence or non- existence.  Before
heaven and earth came into being, it already was
as it is.”126 Im- portantly, Zhuxi’s entire
ontological-cosmological framework is
itself sub-sumed within the li-qi  dynamic.
Rather than taking philosophy as refl  ect- ing
on or commenting about the world, thought
itself is understood to be inculcated within li
, its dual planes of immanence, and the process
of qi.  The very concepts of li and qi  come
exemplary of li  and qi  themselves.  Hence, while
Zhuxi does not solve the antinomy of naturalism
vs. ideal- ism, his philosophy short-circuits
the antinomy in favor of a holistic ontol-ogy
that has become characteristic of much
classical Chinese thought. Wang Yangming
offers an instructive counterpoint to Zhuxi,
who was  criticized by the former for being too
dualist in this thinking. An apocry- phal story
is told by Wang Yangming, who, as a young
scholar, began to undertake a study of Zhuxi’s
idea of the “nature of things.” If, as Zhuxi’s
teachings explained, the li was “in” every
thing in the world, and if, as  Zhuxi’s teachings
also explained, one gained knowledge of li
through the  direct investigation of things,
then it followed that a philosophy of the nature
of things would also be a philosophy of the
investigation of things. Meditation and
inquiry would go hand in hand. Supposedly, Wang
Yang-ming undertook such a study—of a bamboo
plant. He and his colleagues meditated on a
bamboo plant for days (or weeks?), but their
investiga-tion produced no authentic
knowledge of li in itself or even of the plant  as a
plant. Indeed, they even began to feel ill after
the experiment, and promptly called the whole
thing off. 127 Some time later, Wang Yangming
had a revelation about this failed ex-
periment. Whereas at the time he had simply
assumed that it meant he as a philosopher was not
worthy of the practice, let alone
enlightenment, Wang Yangming now began to
wonder whether the whole idea of access-

    </p></div><p>
    
  dark pantheism 237 ing li “in” things out there
was part of the problem. Seeking li in the world 
presumes a number of things—that li  is always
something external to the  thinking subject;
that li is always counterposed to the thinking
subject;  and that li  is always that which is
not-thought— li is non-thinking. Given  this,
in order to gain knowledge of li, one would have
to play and endless  game of cat and mouse,
forever chasing li as something “out there.”
Wang Yangming’s shift was to turn inward. The
principle of li  should  not be sought in things
“out there,” but rather in the mind itself. But
this  was not simply a turn towards idealism. The
very reason one would turn inward is in order to
collapse the interior-exterior split. Once
the mind is cleared of the confusion, clouds,
and froth of the daydream, then what would be
left would be li . This would, in effect, mean
that the mind had  become, strangely, a li
-receptacle. Wang Yangming combined this
insight  with a theory of intuitive knowledge
and action. For our purposes, we can  extend his
notion of li  and suggest that it points to an
“idealist natural- ism,” in which the mind is a
thing, insofar as a thing is its li : “Wherever 
the idea is, we have a thing . . . I say that there
are no principles but those of the mind, and
nothing exists apart from the mind.” 128 If
Zhuxi attempts to resolve the antinomy of
naturalism and idealism  by taking the thought
of li as itself an instance or expression of li 
gener- all y ,  W ang  Y angming’ s  a pp roa ch  is  diff
eren t.  His  p hil osop h y  is  summa -rized in the
phrase “mind ( xin) is principle ( li)”—that is,
li  is mind. The  term xin ( “ mind”) here is, on one
level, the subject, conscious, thinking  mind,
but even this is ultimately a current or a fl  ow of
consciousness,  something that exceeds a fi  xed
interiority. But this then means that the 
assertion that mind is li  would require a
rethinking of the concept of li as  well, as not
simply being a monolithic, unchanging One, as
it tends to be in Zhuxi’s philosophy. Yet such a
proposition is fatal for moral and ethical
philosophy, for not  only must one dispense with
the reliability of a discrete moral subject,
but, if mind and li are equivalent, and if the
former is always in fl  ux while  the latter is
unchanging, then either the self is always
ideational, or the world is nothing but fl  ux and
fl  ow. Either option is interesting, but it re-
quires a great deal. This is a contentious
point, and one that is not fully accounted for in
Wang Yangming’s comments on li. Nevertheless,
Wang  Yangming’s equation of li with mind is not
an assertion of idealism, trans- forming
Zhuxi’s li into something purely ideational.
By stating “mind is  li” Wang Yangming does not
assert that the nature of things is subsumed 
within thought. Instead, it means the
reverse—that thought is subsumed within the
nature of things. We can even extend this and
suggest that

 238 chapter four Wang Yangming’s equation of
mind and li requires the absolute exterior- ity
of thought . And perhaps this is the only way out
of the antinomial bind  of either naturalism or
idealism. One has to recast thought as
something  other than thought—in effect, as
itself the nature of things; conversely, one
has to recast the nature of things as fully
continuous with thought. Life comes to be this
point of transition between an idealism (in
which the world is never present to thought) and
a naturalism (in which the world is omnipresent
to thought). Perhaps this is what the classical
concept of qi  does, at least in the form given by
Neo-Confucian thinkers such as Zhuxi and Wang
Yangming. Qi  not onl y serv es as an al terna ti v e

dissolution: that of the Life that is lived
(sub- jective, ideational) and that of the
lived that is Life (abstract principle). 129

—Bataille 5.1 THE WANDERING LINE FROM
ARISTOTLE TO KANT We began our inquiry with
Aristotle, and we will end with Kant—  specifi 
cally, Kant’s notion of life’s organization,
teleology, and pur- posiveness. Between them,
there is a divergent thread of concepts,
debates,  and dilemmas dealing with the concept
of “life” generally. Saying that they are
“premodern” is simply a way of noting how the
concept of “life” is never simply reduced to
biology (be it mechanistic or vitalist) nor
subli-mated into theology (be it doctrinal or
heretical). In a sense, the real chal-lenge put
forth to speculative thinking in this context
is not how to dis-tinguish philosophy from
theology, but a challenge of a different sort.
For this discontinuous tradition, a tradition
we’ve been referring to as post-Aristotelian
Scholasticism, the challenge is how an
ontology of life can be thought in a way that does
not immediately install the human at its
center, either via an anthropotheological
move (the personal, angry, be-nevolent,
judging God), or via an anthropobiological
move (the ascending pyramid of organization,
order, and development). In this book we have
traced a genealogy of this question through
three  main lines of thought, and a precursor.
That precursor is Aristotle, whose De Anima ,
though it must be read alongside Aristotle’s
works in natural  philosophy, is also the single
work that shapes the ensuing debates on the ques
ti on o f life. I t is th e De Anima  that poses the
question of life, and  poses it as an ontological
question. The way in which Aristotle attempts
to answer this question sets up a framework
within which the concept of life chapter five

 240 chapter five can be thought. This involves
establishing a principle-of-life ( psukhe ¯)
that  accounts for both the multiplicity and the
continuity common to all forms  of life. It also
entails a necessary bifurcation, a
boundary-of- articulation  between Life and
the living. This distinction between Life and
the living makes possible a set of 
relationships that allows one to address three
key components of any on- to l o gy  o f  lif e :  i ts  tem
poral  aspect  ( th e  su per la ti v e  g en erosi ty  o f 
Lif e  vis-à-vis the living, as expressed in the
Pseudo-Dionysius and Eriugena), its formal
aspect (the role of creation or causality
between Life and the living, elaborated in the
debates between Duns Scotus, Aquinas, and
Henry of Ghent), and its spiritual aspect (the
contingency of the living vis-à-vis the
intelligibility of Life, reaching its zenith
in the pantheisms of Eriugena, Nicholas of
Cusa, and Spinoza). In turn, these three
relationships between Life and the living
constitute the three major ways in which the
concept of life has been thought in the West. In
each instance, the ontology of life requires
that one think life in terms of something
other-than-life (time, form, spirit). In many
cases this exigency results in an almost total
eclipse of the concept of life by these other
metaphysical terms. We’ve also seen that any
attempt to formulate an ontology of life 
through these three approaches arrives at a
point in which the intelligibil- ity of life
must also entail its opposite. The notion of
life-as-time entails a contradiction
surrounding affirmation and negation:
superlative life is the affirmation of life as
nihil . Similarly, the notion of life-as-form
revolves  around another contradiction, that
of the additive and the subtractive: the 
analogical relation between Life and the
living must rely upon a more ba-sic univocity
that remains itself uncreated. Finally, the
notion of life-as-spirit is poised around a
contradiction of interiority and
exteriority: the emanative principle of Life
with regard to the living requires an
emana-tion without a center, or a pure
immanence. In each case, a dominant po-sition
is compromised by another, so-called
heretical position. That Life is superlative,
generous, and gift is pushed to the point where
the inac-cessibility of this superlative life
renders it as nothing. That the relation
between Life and the living is one of analogical
creation is pushed to the point where the form of
life opens onto a more fundamental
formlessness. And the idea of Life as a
transcendently emanating principle
(dynamically radiating and yet remaining the
same) is pushed to the point where Life must
disperse and distribute its own emanating
center, becoming at once strangely spiritual
and material. Just as the ontology of life in the
De Anima  revolves around a funda- m e n t al  af f irm

thinkers mentioned thus far. The  table
provides a schematic of these relationships.
The concept of life—and whether such a concept
is possible—places philosophy in a hovering,
wa-vering space between an onto-theology and
an onto-biology. What is at stake in this
concept is something that is more than
epistemological puz-zles or disciplinary
boundaries. In the very thought of life itself

-in-itself, and to what degree there is or can be
an “in-itself” of thought that is not
immediately sublimated into life—the most
adequate thought-of-life would, likewise, be
inaccessible and manifest, like life “in
itself.” In short, thought would become
weirdly inaccessible to thought,
thought-in-itself as inaccessible,
unintelligible. This is the horizon of the
human; but subtracting the human from the 
philosophical problematic of life is
tantamount to foreclosing the possi- bility of
thinking life at all. In a sense, the very
history of W estern phi-losophy is this ongoing
dilemma concerning the very possibility of
“living thought.” The human seems to be the very
ground of the intelligibility of life, insofar
as life presupposes a temporal, formal, and
spiritual dimen-sion. Without a human subject
to think the concept of life, can life be said to
exist at all? This question is exhaustively
formalized by Kant, but it is already apparent
in Aristotle’s De Anima , where the question of
nous (In- tellect), as a privileged instance of
psukhe ¯, raises the question of the life  that
thinks itself. Is the life that thinks itself,
itself living? Or, to borrow Aristotle’s
categories, is Life the living refl  ecting on
itself, as the living?  In a sense, then, what is
at stake in the thought of life is the life of
thought  itself . 5.2 CRITIQUE OF LIFE In many
ways, Kant’s comments on life, organism, and
teleology serve as the point of culmination of
the Aristotelian problematic. At the center of
Kant’s Critique of Judgment  lies the problem of
fi  nality: the question of  order and
organization as it is related to teleology and
purpose in nature. While mechanistic
philosophies of nature may posit an order, that
order is detached from any notion of teleology
or purpose. Mechanistic nature is, in its
extreme versions, merely blind mechanism, a
chance conjunction of causes and effects
governed by natural laws. By contrast, natural
philoso-phies derived from theology
(including, to some degree, early forms of
vi-talism), emphasize the goal-orientedness
of nature, a complex whole that is itself not
evident in any one of its parts. The difficulty
for mechanism is not only how to account for the
apparent complexity and organization of
nature, but also how to account for the
existence of mechanistic natural laws to begin
with. By contrast, the difficulty for vitalism
is not only how to account for the means by which a
complex whole is derived, but also

  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 243 how
to conceptualize a principle of organization
and teleology that is not  theologically
driven. For both approaches, the living
organism epitomizes this problematic,  and in
this way life becomes the privileged locus for
the critical investiga- tion of nature.1 While
mechanism claims to have exhaustively
explained  the genesis and organization of the
organism, in relinquishing any claim to fi
nality, it must necessarily forgo the
distinction between the living  and nonliving,
the organic and inorganic, that is so central to
thinking  about life. It is precisely for this
reason that the living organism is often
fundamental for the various vitalist
philosophies. The living organism is the most
self-evident instance of organization that is
teleological and goal-oriented. This is true
in the more static model of natural history, but
it is also the case in the dynamic and processual
characteristics of the living organism—in its
physiology, its morphology, its embryology,
and so on. So while mechanism accounts for life
in terms of a progressive fi  nality  (e.g., how a
multiplicity of parts and relations interact
to produce a whole),  vitalism accounts for life
in terms of a regressive or retrospective fi 
nality  (e.g., how a complex whole is produced
from a multiplicity of parts and their
relations). The difficulty, according to
Kant, is not so much that order exists in  nature,
and not so much how order exists in nature, but
the way in which a concept of order,
organization, and purpose is situated in a
relation of necessity vis-à-vis the concept of
nature itself. Kant’s challenge is there-fore
how order in nature itself can be determined,
without resorting to ei-ther theology—which
relies upon an order transcendentally granted
from  outside—or to mechanism—which relies on a
posited order that disavows  any teleology.
Claims of fi  nality can be contentious, or at
least uncanny , especially  when they have the
effect of in some way decentering the human
vis-à-vis the natural world. Does human DNA
have as its end the expression of a unique
individual being, or is the human being simply
another way for DNA to replicate itself? Do
microbes subsist off more complex host
organ-isms, or do complex organisms provide a
platform for the persistence of microbial
life? Do we cultivate and eat plants and
animals, or do plants and animals persist
through us and due to us? These games of reversal
are not uncommon in popular science writing;
but at their core is this Kant-ian question
concerning fi  nality in relation to life. Kant
himself poses  a string of such questions: if
rivers carry soil that facilitates the growth
of certain plants, and if human beings benefi  t
by the cultivation of those 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    259
    </p></div><p>
    
 244 chapter five plants, do we suppose that the
plants, the soil, and the river have as their 
purpose human well-being through
agriculture?2 The same follows, Kant  notes,
for the relation of human beings to other life
forms such as plants  and animals, be they
relations of breeding, eating, or
domestication. The dilemma, then, is whether a
claim about fi  nality in nature can  be made
without it immediately being recuperated by
presumptions about usefulness, even if it is of
a fortuitous kind. Beyond this, there is
an-other dilemma, one of the recurring
conceptual motifs in Kant’s critical 
philosophy—how can any claim about fi  nality in
nature be made, when  such a claim must in fact be
made  (that is, by a human subject vis-à-vis a 
world, however that world is conceptualized)?
If one forgoes this possibil- ity, then all of
nature becomes subsumed within the human
viewpoint, which results in effectively
dissolving the concept of nature altogether.
Given this, one has to entertain the notion that
the very idea of nature is always an idea of a
nature for us. One would then have to consider
not just this or that particular purpose or goal
of nature, but a “purposiveness” of nature in
general: Thus if there is to be a concept or a rule
which arises originally from  the power of
judgment, it would have to be a concept of things
in na- ture insofar as nature conforms to our
power of judgment , and thus a  concept of a
property of nature such that one cannot form any
concept of it except that its arrangement
conforms to our faculty for subsum-ing the
particular given laws under more general ones
even though these are not given; in other words,
it would have to be the concept of a
purposiveness ( Zweckmäßigkeit ) of nature in
behalf of our faculty for  cognizing it. 3 Even if
one allows that claims about the fi  nality of
nature cannot be dis- sociated from the
usefulness of nature for us, there still
remains the more  basic problem of the
conditions for which any such claim is possible
at all. For such conditions, one would have to
minimally presuppose some sort of reliable
correlation between our cognitive framework
for interacting with the world, and what
amounts to a necessary, but aporetic, notion of
the world in itself. The condition, for Kant, is
that we must presume some sort of adequate fi  t
between the world and our ability to make
judgments  about the world. Be that as it may, the
concept of “fi  nality” or “purposiveness” (
Zweck- mäßigkeit ) is not simple. Kant uses this
complicated term in a variety of  ways.
“Purposiveness” is not simply an end ( Zweck ) or
a goal ( Endzweck );

    </p></div><p>
    
  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 245 it is
something like the end of the end, a condition in
which an end-of- an-end is possible at all.
Purposiveness is, generally speaking,
something like the conditions for the
possibility of purpose. In the closing
sections of the Critique of Judgment , Kant
makes a number of key distinctions  within
purposiveness. Primary among these is the
distinction between “relative
purposiveness” (sometimes called “external
purposiveness”) and “internal
purposiveness” (sometimes called “objective
purposiveness”). By relative purposiveness
Kant means a purposiveness in relation to a
liv-ing being, be it a relation of usefulness
for human beings, or a relation of
advantageousness for and between animals
(which may include human beings). By contrast,
internal purposiveness is the purposiveness
that is internal to nature when considered in
itself, irrespective of the relations of
usefulness or advantageousness. While Kant
does not suggest that we can co m p l e t e l y  kn o w  na
tur e  in  i ts e lf ,  in  i ts  in t ernal  p urpos i v en ess , 
h e  d oes  note that the idea of an internal
purposiveness shores up the lie of relative
purposiveness, especially when it
masquerades as internal purposiveness: If,
however, the human being, through the freedom
of his causality,  fi nds things in nature
completely advantageous for his often foolish 
aims . . . one cannot assume here even a relative
end of nature . . . For the human’s reason knows
how to bring things into correspondence with
his own arbitrary inspirations, to which he was
by no means pre-destined by nature. Only if one
assumes that human beings have to live on the
earth would there also have to be at least no lack
of the means without which they could not
subsist as animals and even as rational animals
. . . but in that case those things in nature which
are indispens-able for this purpose would also
have to be regarded as natural ends. 4 The aporia
of relative purposiveness lies precisely in
its relativeness—one  must either subsume all
relations to a single “for us,” or, barring
this, one gets caught in an infi  nite regress of
purposes (e.g., the human is the end of  the
sheep, the sheep the end of the grass, the grass
the end of the soil, the soil the end of the rain,
and so on). “From this it can readily be seen that
external purposiveness (advantageousness of
one thing or another) can be regarded as an
external natural end only under the condition
that the ex-istence of that for which it is
advantageous, whether in a proximate or a
distant way, is in itself an end of nature.” 5 How
then should one begin to think the difficult
concept of an inter- nal purposiveness? Kant
effectively proposes a synthesis between a
rela-tive (human-centric) and an internal
(nonhuman oriented) purposiveness, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    261
    </p></div><p>
    
 246 chapter five one that is also a synthesis
between his earlier dichotomy of vitalism and 
mechanism. In what Kant calls a “natural end” (
Naturzweck ), one encom- passes a form of life
that is at once driven by a purposiveness, and
which  at the same time is governed by a set of
internal processes and relations. Kant notes,
in a provisional defi  nition, that “a thing
exists as a natural  end if it is cause and effect
of itself  . . . for in this there lies a causality
the  likes of which cannot be connected with the
mere concept of nature with-out ascribing an
end to it, but which in that case also can be
conceived without contradiction but cannot be
comprehended.” 6 Kant’s example  here is
botanical. The tree, as living, is at once cause
and effect of itself in three ways: as a species
(a tree, following the laws of nature
particular to the species, continues the
species itself), as an individual living being
(the individual tree’s growth and maintenance
over time), and in terms of its parts or organs
(the way that seeds, leaves, roots, and
branches are used in the tree’s life cycle).
Kant’s two criteria for a natural end are (i)
that, akin to vitalism, it be oriented in a way
that leads to the creation of novel forms (“. . .
that its parts are possible only through their
relation to the whole, for the thing itself is an
end”), and (ii) that, akin to mechanism, it
function in a dynamic and processual way solely
from its internal relations (“. . . that its
parts be combined into a whole by being
reciprocally the cause and ef-fect of their
form”). 7 These come together in the idea of the
natural end: In such a product of nature each
part is conceived as if it exists only  through 
all the others, thus as if existing for the sake
of the others   and on account of  the whole . . . it
must be thought of as an organ  that produces  the
other parts (consequently each produces the
others  reciprocally), which cannot be the case
in any instrument of art, but only of nature,
which provides all the matter for instruments .
. . only then and on that account can such a
product, as an organized  and self-  organizing 
being, be called a natural end . 8 It is here that
the concept of the “organized being” or the
organism  plays  a central role. This concept is
in part related to natural history and its 
classifi  catory project of the living—which
presumes an innate order—but  it is also a
logical term, a favorite in Aristotle, and
later, in Scholasticism. The organized being,
or the organism, is unique in that, for Kant, it
works against the mechanistic analogue of the
clock, but also against the vital-ist analogue
of the divine soul. “An organized being is thus
not a mere machine, for that has only a motive 
power, while the organized being pos- sesses in
itself a formative power . . . thus it has a
self-propagating forma-

  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 247 tive
power, which cannot be explained through the
capacity for movement  alone.”9 The organism is
that which is at once means and the ends, and it  is
this, more than any other attribute, that
serves as the basis for Kant’s  distinctions
between nature and artifi  ce, organic and
inorganic, the living  and the nonliving. The
organized being, the organism, is Kant’s
privileged example of a  natural end. But it is
also the limit of our ability to effectively
think life apart from the dichotomous split
between refl  ective (subjective and expe-
riential) and internal (objective and
inaccessible) purposiveness. Specify-ing
what this limit is proves difficult for Kant.
The organism has a kind of purposiveness, but
one that is not directed from without. It may be
analogized to the theological model of the
divine soul, or to the aesthetic model of art.
Whatever the case, the type of purposiveness of
the organ-ism begins to become identical to the
processes of the organism itself—“
purposiveness” begins to perfectly overlap
with “processiveness.” What  it is equals how it
is. Kant struggles to fi  nd an adequate
conceptual fi  gure  for describing this
apparent equivalence of the “what” and the
“how”: Perhaps one comes closer to this
inscrutable property if one calls it an 
analogue of life : but then one must either endow
matter as mere matter  with a property
(hylozoism) that contradicts its essence, or
else associ-ate with it an alien principle
standing in communion  with it (a soul) . . .  But
inner natural perfection , as it is possessed by
those things that  are possible only as natural
ends  and hence as organized beings, is not 
thinkable and explicable in accordance with
any analogy to any physi-cal, i.e., natural
capacity that is known to us. 10 J u s t  a s  Kan t  b e

i v e l y  t r an s - forming the organism and the idea
of natural end into a limit-concept. As he
repeatedly notes, just because a network of
rivers promotes social relations between
villages, and just because the nearby
mountains serve as the source of the rivers and
storehouses of snow, and just because the
geography of the land as a whole allows for the
rivers to fl  ow and drain,  none of this really
legitimizes a claim about natural
purposiveness. The problem is not simply that
of subjectivism, but of the very condition of
the self-world relation generally. The
concept of life—as the privileged category of
nature—serves to demonstrate this
problematic for Kant. Life is ambivalently
positioned between self and world, at once a set
of enti-ties “out there” (e.g., crops for food,
livestock for breeding) and yet a con-tinuum
that connects the “out there” to the “in here”
(the principle of

rationale for a fi  nality of life cannot
adequately separate itself from that  same life
viewed in terms of advantageousness. Such a
logic of means and  ends merely demonstrates the
impossibility of distinguishing a relative
(“for us”) from an objective (“in itself”)
purposiveness. “In things that one has no cause
to regard as ends for themselves, an external
relationship can be judged to be purposive only
hypothetically.” 11 The conciliatory move
that Kant makes is to regard the concepts of 
organized being and natural end as “regulatory
concepts,” whose func-tion is to place limits
on the use of the cognitive faculties of reason
or the understanding, beyond which only poetry
or mysticism can lie. But this regulatory
function also opens onto another possibility,
which is that the organized being or organism
provides “objective reality for the concept of
an end that is not a practical end but an end of
nature ,” a task that Kant  allocates to natural
science and the necessity of something like
life in it-self. But then natural science is
confronted with an antinomy, which is re-ally
an antinomy of Life : either the emergence of
life forms is explainable  solely in terms of
mechanical laws, or else there is something
that governs the emergence of life forms that is
not manifest in the entities and rela-tions
that those mechanical laws determine. The
challenge then becomes how to think a concept of
life, as “internally caused” and as
“reciprocally cause and effect,” that is at the
same time not reducible to its components and
relations. As Kant notes, somewhat
enigmatically , “[T]he end of the existence of
nature itself must be sought beyond nature.” 12
This is not a task only for natural science or for
biology, for the issue  that recurs throughout
the Critique of Judgment  is how the idea of
purpo- siveness is marked by a conceptual
duplicity: it is at once that which must
necessarily remain inaccessible to us, and yet
that which is necessary for a concept of life or
nature to be though t at all. This leads to one of
the greatest insights of the “Critique of the
Teleological Power of Judgment”: any ontology
of life must presume an a priori concept of fi 
nality , the latter  defi ned as the conjunction
of organization with teleology. Part of this
is,  in a way, a repetition of Aristotle’s
statement in the De Anima : “nature  does nothing
in vain.” And Kant notes how necessary the idea
of fi  nality  is to the then-burgeoning fi  elds of
natural history and biology: “It is well  known
that the anatomists of plants and animals . . .
assume as indispens-ably necessary the maxim
that nothing in such a creature is in vain. ” 13
Stating it in this way is misleading, however.
For Kant’s a priori of life  is really a question,
and the a priori has a number of dimensions to it.
It is, fi rst, a statement about the necessary
preconditions for the concept of

  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 249 life
to be thought at all—that precondition being,
for Kant, that of fi  nality  (order and end,
organization and teleology). But this a priori
is not with- out its own aporias, an
always-receding horizon that tries to avoid
both the reduction to mechanism as well as the
sublimation into vitalism. In a vicious
circle, one posits fi  nality as an a priori, and
then undertakes the  project of discovering
what one originally posited. To these two
dimen- sions is added a third, which is the more
pragmatic, “regulative” function of the a
priori as a limit, one that perhaps governs
where philosophy ends and theology begins (or
where science ends and poetry begins . . .).
Taken together, the upshot of Kant’s a priori of
life offers a further development of
Aristotle’s question: What is the relation
between the thought of life and living thought,
the life of thought itself? 5.3 SPECTRAL LIFE
AND SPECULATIVE REALISM Between Aristotle and
Kant there is a great deal; indeed, there is too
much. One jumps over the long tradition of
philosophical refl  ection on biology,  from the
Historia Animalium , to Cartesian mechanism,
to Buffon and  the work of classifi  cation, let
alone stopping short of eighteenth-century 
German biology, Lamarck, and Darwin. One also
side-steps the equally  important, though
largely forgotten, tradition of natural
theology and  theophany—as well as its perverse
underside, the bestiary and the teratol- ogy.
For every work on the Creation there is a work
such as the heteron-omous Aberdeen Bestiary ,
or an Ambrose Paré, whose On Monsters and 
Marvels  e ff e c t i v e l y  p r o d u c e s  a  t e r a t o l o gy  o n 
th e  C r ea t i o n  o f  a b e rr a t i o n ;   for every treatise
outlining a hierarchy of angels and “spiritual
creatures” there is a De Malo  or another work of
Scholastic demonology that raises the  problem
of necromancy, possession, and decay as a
philosophical limit. However, from the
lowliest beast to the darkest luminosity of the
di- vine, from the “worm in the blood” to the
swarming chorus of spiritual creatures, there
remains this question about the
intelligibility of life as something that may
not be fundamentally or even incidentally
rooted in the human. While the shape and contour
of philosophical thinking changes
drastically after Aristotle and
Scholasticism, the triad of life-as-time,
life-as-form, and life-as-spirit is
remarkable in its persistence. Sometimes one
fi  nds them parsed out into distinct
approaches, as when  the question of experience
(the question of the human par excellence) is
couched in terms of time, temporality, and an
existential proximity to death (and it is thus
no surprise that, for Sartre and the early
Heidegger, the question of an ontology of life
is not a question at all, or is at least subordi-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    265
    </p></div><p>
    
 250 chapter five nate to the loftier question of
phenomenality and self- consciousness). This 
emphasis on time and temporality takes on a
different guise in  process  philosophy
(Whitehead) and process theology (Chardin),
where the human,  all-too-human question of
experience is dissolved into a background fl  ux 
of prehensions and a nexus of relations. More
often than not, however, this  triad of
time-form-spirit is found in some admixture.
In the organicism of the early Hegel,
temporality is tightly linked to the question
of form, which is itself framed by the principle
of Geist . Some version of life-as- spirit
profoundly marks the Lebensphilosophie 
thinkers, often to such a  degree that, as
Schelling indicates, life can perfectly
coincide with death  along a continuum. Even in
the well-worn dichotomy of mechanism and
vitalism, we fi  nd a hidden commonality, which
is a contestation over the  relation between
life-as-time and life-as-spirit—mechanism
upholding the  former while negating the
latter, vitalism privileging the latter as the
ba-sis for the former. And it is perhaps because
of this false dichotomy that we fi nd an attempt
at a synthesis in Bergson’s Creative Evolution
(where  both mechanism and fi  nalism are
critiqued in favor of an emphasis on the 
superlative, inventive nature of a vital
force, the élan vital ). Life-as-time,
life-as-form, and life-as-spirit. Perhaps,
given the persis- tence of these three
approaches, we can abbreviate them even
further: life is al w ays “ m ea t” ( th e thi ckn ess ,
th e facti ci ty of life ), “ soul ” ( th e formal
principle of the creation of life), or
“pattern” (the intangible plane of
or-ganization running throughout life). In
each case, we fi  nd an attempt to  ontologize life
in terms of something other than life. The
question then  becomes, if the condition of
intelligibility of life is that life be
understood in terms of something
other-than-life (time, form, spirit), at what
point does an on to l ogy of life qui te sim p l y
becom e an on to l ogy of tim e , or of form, or of
spirit itself? In the attempt to ontologize
life, does life dissipate precisely at the
moment of its greatest conceptual clarity? It
goes without saying that the major challenge
that faces philosophi- cal refl  ection on the
concept of life is not about the most accurate or
co- herent defi  nition of life. Life as a concept
quite effortlessly passes between  the poles of
reductionism and mysticism—life can be defi 
ned down to the  molecular level, at the same time
that the notion of the irreducibility and
mystery of life raises the concept up to
existential and spiritual levels. Instead,
the major challenge for any ontology of life
lies in being able to think its very conditions
of being thought at all. This leads to what
amounts to a methodological issue. If we
presume  that there is something called life
that is neither simply God nor Being, and if we
also presume that this life is also minimally
intelligible—even

  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 251 to
the extent that it can be thought in its
unintelligibility—then what sort  of an object
for thought is life? In the history of
philosophy, the problem of discerning the
object of thought is often equivalent to
thought itself. Thought always presupposes or
necessitates an object of thought, even if that
object of thought is thought itself. This as is
evident in Parmenides’ poem  as  i t  is  in  th e 
Phaedrus , and it not only characterizes the
system  building of a Descartes or a Kant, but it
also haunts the dismantling ges- tures of a
Nietzsche or a Bataille. The question of
thought and its object is also a central part of
logical  philosophy. It is formulated quite
clearly in Aristotle’s Categoreia , it serves 
as the backdrop for later thinkers like Fichte
or Wittgenstein, and it is now a substantial
part of any textbook on philosophical logic.
More recently, it has been revived by thinkers
who deny the rather academic but long-standing
split between continental and analytical
philosophy, while also reinvigorating the
classical questions of the modern Western
philosophical tradition. For example,
Quentin Meillassoux uses the term
“correlation” to talk about the problem of the
self-world relationship, a problem that is a
deep preoccupation for thinkers such as Hume
and Fichte: “By ‘correlation’ we mean the idea
according to which we only ever have access to
the cor-relation between thinking and being,
and never to either term considered apart from
the other.” 14 Correlationism is what is
produced when a phi - losophy wishes to avoid the
poles of either naïve idealism (that the world
“out there” is totally reducible to thought),
or naïve realism (that there is something
called a world “out there” totally independent
of our thinking about that world). What results
is a compromise, one in which correlation-ism
“consists in disqualifying the claim that it is
possible to consider the realms of
subjectivity and objectivity independently
of one another. Not only does it become
necessary to insist that we never grasp an
object ‘in it-self’ . . . but it also becomes
necessary to maintain that we can never grasp a
subject that would not always-already be
related to an object.” 15 In its simplest
version, correlationism has the form “ all
thought of X  is always the thought  of X.” While
the concept of correlation derives from  an
ontological quandary—that of subject and
object, or self and world—it also has a form that
can be applied to philosophical systems
generally, and which neatly encapsulates the
dilemma of many modern ontologies. As
Meillassoux notes, “Correlationism rests on
an argument as simple as it is powerful, and
which can be formulated in the following way; No
X without givenness of X, and no theory about X
without a positing of X.” 16  Note that
correlationism in this sense is not simply the
science-fi  ctional  dilemma of “what is real.”
It encompasses both the poles of idealism
(“it’s 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    267
    </p></div><p>
    
 252 chapter five all in your head”) and realism
(the world “out there”). It is the very condi-
tion for thought to either disavow or engage
with its object. At the root of correlationism
is the relation of thought to its object, or  the
relation between self and world, on which we can
briefl  y meditate. In  one sense, the terms of
self and world are intimately tied to each
other: the self cannot be thought without
relation to the world, just as the world
requires a thought-of-the-world that implies
a self that is thinking this t h o u gh t .  E x t e n din g 
t h i s  fur t h e r ,  t h e  s e lf  m u s t  in  s o m e  s e n s e  b e  un d e
r -stood in terms of the world, if only to note
that the self is “in” the world, or, conversely,
that the self removes or distances itself from
the world, in order to think it. Here an
asymmetry develops, for the self requires a
world in order to think itself “in” the world,
but, at the same time, the world must remain
inaccessible “in itself,” else it simply
becomes a part of the self (imagined by the self,
an “imaging” of the world). In this asymmetry,
the very defi  nition of the world is that which is
at once necessary for and  yet inaccessible to
the thinking self. The thought of the self
requires the  “unthought” of the world. It is
worth noting how the post-Aristotelian
Scholastic discourses sur- rounding life are
echoed in modern correlationism, but with a
twist. Neg-ative theology, as we’ve seen,
effectively transforms correlationism into
aporia, but one that turns out to be necessary
for thinking the superlative character of
life. The debates over creatura  and the
Creator-creature re- lation reframe
correlationism in terms of the production of
novel forms, such that correlation is
inseparable from creation. Finally, the
discourse on the divine nature, which reaches
its limit in a heretical pantheism, takes up the
importance of contingency in correlationist
thinking and expands it into an absolute
(effectively recasting contingency in terms
of immanence). In a similar vein, Kantian
transcendental philosophy argues that it is 
not an idealism due to the a priori status of the
sensibility, and the divi-sion between
noumena  and phenomena  that follows from this.
Kantian- ism is not idealism because the
subject is always positioned vis-à-vis an
object. This is the Kantian variant of
correlationism. Similarly, the Hus-serlian
phenomenological tradition argues that it is
not idealism because consciousness is always
consciousness of something. The notion of
inten-tionality not only secures the place of
the human subject, but it also es-tablishes the
necessity of its relation to the object-world.
Paradoxically, intentionality also makes
possible the phenomenological method of
ab-straction, or the epoche ¯. The
phenomenal-existential analysis developed 
by Heidegger shifts the question from
consciousness to being, or rather, to 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    268
    </p></div><p>
    
  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 253
being as Da-sein , being-in-the-world. The
thrownness of the subject is the  testimony
against any idealism. In these examples,
correlationism is utilized as a refutation of
naïve  idealism, while at the same time keeping
at bay the question of the world- in - i t s e lf .  F o r 
Kan t  thi s  i s  d o n e  b y  th e  e m p h a s i s  o n  p h e n o m e na  ( n
o t  th e  world-in-itself but our perception of
the world-in-itself), for Husserl this is
accomplished by the idea that consciousness is
always a consciousness-of something, and for
Heidegger this notion is recast in terms of
Da-sein . But  what happens when correlationism
either refuses or fails to keep at bay this
question of the world-in-itself? One result is
what Meillassoux calls “subjectivist
metaphysics,” which is “any absolutization of
a determinate human access to the world.” 17
This mode of thought entails an absolutiza-
tion of the correlation itself as reality. Some
part or all of the human access  to reality is
expanded to such a degree that it becomes
equivalent to reality itself. In this extreme
position, “the subjectivist claims that some
of these relations, or indeed all, are
determinations not only of men, but of being
itself. He projects onto the things themselves
a correlation which might be perception,
intellection, desire, etc., and makes it the
absolute itself.” 18 As Alain Badiou notes,
this sort of radical subjectivism is as true for 
the absolutization of the subjective access to
the world as it would be for the reverse—the
absolutization of the objective point of
contact with the subject. This is one point
where phenomenology intersects with the
philosophy of vitalism. In the former case, one
expands intentionality to such a degree that it
effectively compasses the world, whereas in
the latter case one “ makes of life the active
name of being. ” 19 In both cases, there  is a
reliance on some minimally positive notion of
“the One,” a kind of  “sur- existence” that
provides the backdrop from which a claim about
mul- tiplicity, process, or a creative
evolution can possibly be made. To think
otherwise would be, for Badiou, to think of this
backdrop itself in terms of negation or
being-nothing ( néantisé ): “We can thus say
that the term  that is common to both
phenomenology and vitalism—to Husserl and to
Bergson, to Sartre and to Deleuze—is death, as
that which certifi  es fi nite  existence, that
which is the simple state of an infi  nite
sur-existence.” 20 Presumably the various
ontologies based on duration, process, or be-
coming are indicative of this vitalist
thinking. So, while these philoso-phies make a
claim to have overcome or surpassed the
correlationist im-passe, from the
correlationist point of view, they have simply
failed to adequately acknowledge the dual
necessity of all thought (e.g., “there is no X
without a positing of X”). For the
correlationist, any ontology that privileges
duration, process, or becoming as the
primordial or “abstract” 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

    </p></div><p>
    
 254 chapter five fl ux of the world beyond the
self-world relation is simply a mode of thought 
that takes one part of the contingent human
access to the world (e.g., the  human experience
of time in terms of continuity) and then renders
that as an absolute property of the world in
itself. In all of these cases, the reality that
is posited is predicated on a basic
relation—that there can be a reality only if
there is some sort of subjective access to that
reality. But it is also worth refl  ecting on the
failure of this sort of vitalist think- ing, the
thought that fails to uphold the
correlationist impasse. What does “failure”
mean in this context? In these cases,
correlationism fails to con-serve the two key
components of its thinking: (i) the separation
of thought and object, self and world, and (ii)
the inseparability or the necessity of their
interrelation (which presumes the fi  rst step
of separation). If this is a  failure, it is,
perhaps, an interesting one, one that is in fact
produced from a concept of life that is at its
core. Let us say that a vitalist  correlation is
one  that fails to conserve the correlationist
dual necessity of the separation  and
inseparability of thought and object, self and
world, and which does so based on some
ontologized notion of “life.” Furthermore,
this vitalist cor-relation can be
comprehended within the correlationist
framework only if it is understood as the
absolutization of the contingent. The point
here is not that Bergsonian duration,
Whiteheadian process, or Deleuzian becom-ing
offer a more progressive ontology than the
concepts of Kant, Husserl, or Heidegger.
Rather, what we should highlight is the way in
which this vitalist correlation relies upon a
rather encrypted, hidden concept of life that
enables it to traverse correlation itself. All
of this leads to a simple question, one that is at
the heart of the  ontology of life: is life
correlational ? In other words, are all thought
of life  and all ontologies that attempt to
provide the basis for the intelligibility of
life, are all these situated within the
correlationist framework? A number of
possibilities present themselves: 1st reply:
Existential (the correlation of life and
death) There is, as a fi  rst possibility, the
existential correlation to death. Here  the
correlation at the heart of the concept of life
could be understood  as the somewhat
traditional, if overused, dichotomy between
life and death. While life can be known to the
extent that it is lived, death re-mains
inaccessible and yet necessary for thinking
(or living) life. This is the existentialist
variant of correlational life. It holds
equally even when one parses out death (as
Heidegger does) into “Death” and
“per-ishing.” The problem is that the
distinction that grounds the correla-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    270
    </p></div><p>
    
  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 255 tion
(the absolutism of the mutual exclusivity of
life and death) tends to  wear away upon further
refl  ection. For instance, this is not simply an 
oppositional relationship, for many inquires
into life itself— including 
Lebensphilosophie , Merleau-Pontian
phenomenology, and process  metaphysics—fi  nd
that, upon refl  ection, the boundary
separating life  and death becomes
increasingly blurry. Hence some ontological
frame-work of a continuum comes to replace or
displace the boundary of life and death. 2nd
reply: Organicist (the correlation of growth
and decay) If the existential correlation of
life and death is undone by one par- ticular
concept of “life”—life as that which is
lived—then there is an-other, second
possibility, which is the organicist
correlation of growth and decay. Here we move
beyond absolute terms like life and death, and
consider the temporal aspect of life, in which
the primary relation is between growth and
decay, development and decomposition, or, as
Aristotle notes, between “coming-to-be” and
“passing-away.” This has not only biological
resonance, but theological as well—what the
prob-lem of decay and putrefaction is for the
history of biology, the problem of
resurrection is for Medieval theology.
Arguably these two problems have their
cultural manifestation in the gothic (Poe,
Baudelaire, and graveyard poetry . . .).
However, the distinction in this correlation
again tends to break down, and growth becomes
decay, development becomes decomposition,
the corpse becomes nutritive food for worms and
soil, and so on—the negative term simply
becomes a new type of generative order,
decomposition becomes a new type of
composition. 21 3rd reply: Ontological (the
correlation between Life and the living) Both
of these variants of the vitalist
correlation—the existential- ist and
organicist versions—revolve around some
concept of life that ultimately undoes the
correlation itself, thereby enabling some
sort of transversalist, immanentist
thinking. But they are both based on a more
fundamental relation. In addition to the
correlation of life in terms of opposition
(life/death) or mirroring (growth/decay),
there is, as we’ve seen throughout this study, a
more basic relation, one that is ontological.
Aristotle gives us such a relation—that of the
relation between Life and the living (or
that-by-which-the-living-is-living and 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    271
    </p></div><p>
    
 256 chapter five that-which-is-living). Here
one term (the living) is immediate and in-
tuitive, while the other term (Life) is
mediated and abstract. As a cor-relation, what
results is a bit awkward: The living is lived
(experience, subjectivity, phenomena ),
while Life is the un-lived (concept, objectiv-
ity, and, strangely, noumena ). It is a
correlation in the sense that the  living cannot
be understood without a more general, abstract
concept of Life, which enables the living to be
thought as living, but which also remains in
itself inaccessible (there is no example of
Life, only of the living). The question remains
whether the Life/living distinction—as a
correlation—is ultimately recuperated into a
vitalist correlation (Life is that which cuts
across all instances of the living), or whether
it tends towards an absolute
incommensurability (Life is never present in
itself, and is not a manifestation). In a sense,
none of these replies is adequate. The terms of
correlationism  (critical-Kantian,
phenomenological-Husserlian, and vitalist-
Bergsonian)  all rely on a basic distinction
between self and world, thought and object.  But
life does not so easily split into,
respectively, self and world, thought and
object, phenomena  and noumena . Should we say
that, if the living is  equivalent to phenomena , 
th en  Life  is  equi v al en t  to  noumena ? But it is 
precisely the dilemma of Life that it is
intelligible only to the extent that it is
manifested in the living, all the while
remaining inaccessible “in it-self . ” Correla
ti onism is also based on an asymm etry tha t is roo
ted in a kind of topological game of position and
perspective. What makes a corre-lation a
correlation is the impossibility of passing
from one position (self) to the other (world),
even though there is a mutual dependency
between them. But what is the perspective of
life? In a way, one does not regard life solely
from the point of view of self or world; one does
not regard Life solely from the point of view of
the living, and vice-versa. Correlationism
is, fi nally, based not just on position but on a
relation of some sort between  self and world. It
is thus predicated on a human-centric view
that, at the same time, shores up its own limits
(the empirical defi  ned in relation to 
perception, and perception in relation to
verifi  cation). But as we’ve tried to  show in the
previous chapters, Life and the living have
little to do with the human. While an ontology of
life may posit, as its pinnacle, the human as the
privileged form of life (be it in terms of nous or
the cogito ), such an  ontology has, as its
necessary predicate, the non-exclusivity of
life vis-à-vis the human (even insofar as
animal, plant, microbial, or mineral life are
subsumed within the human). Ultimately, the
point we are led to is the insufficiency of
correlation-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    272
    </p></div><p>
    
  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 257 ism
vis-à-vis any ontology of life. But this is not
because the vitalist cor- relation of
duration, process, and becoming somehow
escape the strictures of correlationism.
Instead, it is because the vitalist
correlation is ontologi- cally predicated not
on a concept of being, but on a concept of
life—even  at the same time that the latter must
ambivalently presume the former .  This concept
of life enables a third step to be added to the fi 
rst two of  correlationism: fi  rst, the
separation of thought and object, self and
world;  second, the positing of their
reciprocal interrelation; and, added to this, 
a third step, which is the further positing of a
contradiction that doubles back and
encompasses the correlation itself. L if e  i s  a t 
o n ce  an  o b j e c t  o f  th o u gh t ,  an  o b j e c t  o f  s tu d y ,  e v
e n ,  o f  th e   living “out there,” and at the same
time precisely that which is lived “in  here,”
within a conceptual framework of intuition and
immediacy. These dual notions of life are at
once mutually exclusive and reciprocally
neces-sary to think life in one way or another
(e.g., as biology or phenomenology, natural or
existential). For the vitalist correlation,
then, what enables its absolutism is a
contradiction  at the heart of correlation . 5.4
ONTOTHEOLOGY IN KANT, ATHEOLOGY IN BATAILLE As
a subject of philosophical refl  ection, life is
a strange concept, at once  the most opaque and
reifi  ed, and at the same time the most immediate
and  intuitive. To question life in terms of its
ontological status would seem
ridiculous—questioning the existence, or,
shall we say, the “realism” of life would be
tantamount to questioning existence itself.
However as we’ve seen, there are a number of
traditions in post-Aristotelian Scholastic
thinking that do exactly this. Or rather, there
is an entire pre-Kantian tra-dition for
thinking about life ontologically that opens
onto both dominant and minoritarian strands.
This invites us to think about how these
premodern, pre-Kantian on- tologies of life
might impact a post-Kantian refl  ection on the
topic. Such  an approach would, in Ray
Brassier’s words, adopt “a willingness to
re-interrogate or to open up a whole series of
philosophical problems that were taken to have
been defi  nitively settled by Kant.” 22 As
Brassier notes,  principle among these would be
a re-interrogation of Kant’s oft-referenced
Copernican revolution in philosophy: [T]he
term “realist” in continental philosophy is
usually taken to be  some kind of insult—only
someone who hasn’t really understood Kant
could ever want to rehabilitate something like
metaphysical realism,

does not depend upon some kind of tran-
scendental guarantor . . . And in a way, it
doesn’t really matter whether you claim to have
replaced the subject and the object with some
form of communicational consensus or
being-in-the-world or any variant of the
latter on these issues: The transcendental
function has been vari-ously encoded in
different versions of post-Kantian
continental philos-ophy. But the thing that
seems to be assumed within this tradition . . . is
that whatever structure there is in the world
has to be transcenden-tally imposed or
generated or guaranteed. 23 We have seen how
Kant’s refl  ections on purposiveness and
teleology vis- à-vis life eventually revolve
around a fundamental contradiction. In this 
way, Kantian purposiveness  recapitulates
Aristotelian entelechy . Both  grapple with the
idea that there is some sort of innate
orderliness or orga-nization in life that
serves as the fundamental guarantor that the
question o f  L if e  i s  dif f e r e n t  fr o m  e i th e r  th e  q u
e s t i o n  o f  B e in g  o r  th e  q u e s t i o n  o f  God. And both
Aristotle and Kant also grapple with whether
this orderli-ness that is innate to life, this
vital order, can be said to be fully internal to
life itself, or whether it must have some sort of
external source. In a way, Kant himself offers a
way of reframing this question through  h i s  c o m m
e n t s  o n  t h e o l o gy  g e n e r a l l y .  K a n t ’ s  c o m m e n t s  o n 
t h e o l o gy  a r e  readily apparent in the Critique
of Pure Reason , where he discusses the 
antinomies of pure reason, which have to do with
topics such as whether the cosmos had an
absolute beginning, or whether the existence
of God can be proved, and so on. At the end of the
Critique of Judgment , Kant  refl ects again on
the antinomies related to purposiveness,
nature, and life.  The difficulty is that if one
assigns the order, organization, or
purposive-ness of life to some component of
life, how then can one avoid assigning
causality and thus a certain authorship to life
itself? For Kant, this can be avoided only if
this assignation of purposiveness is taken to
be internal to life itself: “The expression ‘an
end of nature’ is already enough to preclude
this confusion so that there is no mix-up
between natural science and the occasion it
provides for the teleological  judging of its
objects and the con- sideration of God, and thus
a theological  derivation.” 24 But it is in the
later lectures on what Kant calls “rational
theology”  that we see the most coherent and
systematic treatment of the topic. While Kant
argues against any unfounded judgment
concerning a transcendent author of life, his
formulation of the problem is relevant in that
it gets at the basic problem of any
investigation into life (or, in Aristotle’s
terms, Life and the living), any investigation
that posits an ontology concerning

  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 259 the
innate and inherent orderliness of
that-which-is-living. Thus any “at- tempt of
reason to infer from the ends  of nature (which
can be cognized  only empirically) to the
supreme cause of nature and its properties”
must  fail, insofar as the totality of life
cannot be at once the object of an intu-ition. 25
Kant calls this sort of judgment
“physicotheology”: Now I say that
physicotheology, no matter how far it might be
pushed,  can reveal to us nothing about a fi  nal
end  of creation; for it does not  even reach the
question about such an end . . . How one even has
rea-son for assuming that nothing in the world
is in vain, but that every-thing in nature  is
good for something, under the condition that
certain  things should exist (as ends), hence
for assuming that our reason can provide the
power of judgment with no other principle of the
possibil-ity of the object for its unavoidable
teleological judging than the prin-ciple of
subordinating the mechanism of nature to the
architectonic of an intelligent
world-author: the teleological view of the
world answers all of this magnifi  cently and
extremely admirably. But since the data  and
hence the principles for determining  that
concept of an intelligent  world-cause . . . are
merely empirical, they do not allow us to infer
any properties beyond what experience reveals
to us in its effects: which, since it can never
comprehend the whole of nature as a system, must
often hit upon grounds of proof that (to all
appearance) contradict one another. 26 In
Kant’s rather wordy diatribe, the idea of an
anthropomorphic cause or  author to life is
brought under the scrutiny of a critical
philosophy, which questions any claims that
are effectively divorced from the basic
corre-lation of self and world. Beyond this,
one is merely speculating, and the arguments
for or against some type of higher, divine, or
intelligent design will go on ad infi  nitum,
precisely because pure reason can be brought in
to  support either claim. But the further
problem, the problem specifi  c to the question
of life— that is, “life” as Kant’s privileged
exemplar of “nature”—is that any claim  for
purposiveness in life must deal in some way with
its non-totality. This is arguably as true for
laws of nature (even of the “self-organizing”
type) as it is for the claims of natural theology
and the contemporary forms of “divine
Darwinism.” Life is not total in the three
general ways that we’ve outlined in this book.
It is temporally based, and thus cannot be
grasped in a single observation; it is rooted in
the dynamics of possible forms and forming; and
its changeability raises the question of some

 260 chapter five principle that is common to
each of its particular instances. In short,
even  a non-anthropomorphic,
non-transcendent concept of purposiveness
must confront the notion that, interestingly,
life as a topic for ontology must necessarily be
speculative. It is perhaps for this reason that
Kant’s later lectures on theology deal  with the
question of purposiveness. Kant’s interest
here is not just dis- tinguishing philosophy
from theology, nor even in distinguishing
theol-ogy from biology or natural philosophy.
Theology, in one sense, comes to have a purely
practical role, giving meaning to the
world—the world “for us”—as well as to guide
human action in the world. But there is another
function Kant gives to theology, one that is
less human-centric, and, in a way, less
humanistic altogether. In a sense, theology
for Kant is a perfect example of a kind of
thinking that is predicated on the limits of
thought itself. Theology becomes a kind of refl 
ection on antinomy itself, especially  in the
form it takes in the Critique of Judgment —as a
question about  the ontology of life. We can
extend the Kantian defi  nition a bit, and sug-
gest that theology is an inquiry into the
thought of that which cannot be thought (which,
in the context of Medieval philosophy, is
understood to be the divine or supernatural).
However Kant actually distinguishes between
different varieties of theology, and it is
worth elaborating his system. For Kant, all
theology is, in a sense, “ontotheology.” But
what is onto- theology? “It is the system of the
knowledge of the highest being.” 27 But, as  Kant
points out, this endeavor—to think the highest
being ( ens summum ),  to think the
being-of-all-beings ( ens originarium )—is a
paradoxical one,  for such a thought is by defi 
nition beyond thought itself. Kant here
implies  an important insight from the start, an
insight that was, many centuries earlier,
central to the tradition of negative theology:
theology implies a p hil o s o p h y  o f  a b s o l u t e  limi
t s—o r ,  w ha t  am o un t s  t o  th e  s am e  thing,  an 
ontology of contradiction. Ontotheology is
the thought of “a being which excludes every
defi  - ciency,” which includes both the notion
of an ens summum  and an ens  originarium . 28 In
ontotheology, one uses reason alone, divorced
from all  experience, to speculate about a
fundamental basis for being. In ontothe-ology
one begins from a thinking, living self to make
speculative claims about a divine source of
being—claims that, of course, can never be
vali-dated beyond the use of pure reason
itself. Ontotheology is, then, some-thing
like the thought of the being-of-life . To this
is added what Kant  calls “cosmotheology,” the
thought of a “being which contains all
reali-ties in itself.” 29 Whereas
ontotheology is concerned with the
being-of-life, 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    276
    </p></div><p>
    
  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 261
cosmotheology is concerned with the
world-of-life , not in any particular  instance
or state, but the life in and of the world
generally, a world-of- life governed by laws or
exhibiting universal attributes. If
ontotheology is concerned with a highest being
or being-of-all-beings, then cosmotheology
is concerned with a highest intelligence or
divine order ( summa intelli- gentia ). If
ontotheology is rooted in the notion of a divine
principle, then  cosmotheology is rooted in the
notion of a divine author or design. One  begins
from the life in general and then makes claims
about the laws or the design of that
life-in-general. Ontotheology and
cosmotheology are united in their use of pure  
reason, even though one begins from a thinking
self or the world- in-general. But
physicotheology is, for Kant, different, in
that, like the former two, it also makes
untenable claims about purposiveness, but it
specifi  cally starts from the idea of
life-as-it-is . Here phenomena do play a  role,
but they are quickly sublimated into the
abstraction of the life-as-it-is to the
world-of-life, and fi  nally to the
being-of-life. For physicotheology,  the
primary thought is thus the summum bonum , “the
highest good, to  which wisdom and morality
belong.” 30 In physicotheology, this concern 
for life-as-it-is makes possible the
Aristotelian “good life” or qualifi  ed life; 
life-as-it-is thus begins from a sort of primal
scene, in which all the at- tributes of
life-as-it-is orbit around the human subject
that governs those attributes from its fi  xed
center. In a sense, physicotheology shores up
the anthropomorphism of both  ontotheology and
cosmotheology. In its concern with
life-as-it-is, it is a  concern with
life-as-it-is for us . Hence Kant
characterizes physicotheology  as being
rooted in a divine rule or ruler, rather than a
divine author (cos-motheology) or a divine
principle (ontotheology). Physicotheology
is the most explicit instance of a
human-centric ontology of life; but it is also
predicated on the cosmotheological and
ontotheological views, insofar as
life-as-it-is presumes a minimal notion of
life in general (world-of-life) that would
occasion any particular instance of
life-as-it-is, as well as requiring some
minimal intelligibility of life-in-itself
(being-of-life) for the concept to be thought
at all. The limit, then, of the relation between
theology and philosophy is not  just a
regulative limit. It does not only demarcate
the line beyond which well-grounded reason
must give way to mysticism or poetry. Kant tends
to submerge some of the most interesting
questions concerning theology by reassigning
to them a moral-pragmatic function. What is
less evident, though equally important, is the
way that theology for Kant also serves 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    277
    </p></div><p>
    
 262 chapter five to shore up not only the limits
of reason, but the limits of philosophical 
thinking itself, when this latter is always
compromised by the persistent predicate of the
“for us.” In a sense, this is precisely what
Georges Bataille recovers from theology,  at
least in its Medieval and
mystical-theological guise. For Bataille,
theol-ogy does not simply demarcate the line
beyond which philosophy cannot or should not
go; it also negatively articulates a void at the
heart of philo-sophical thinking itself—it is
an “anti-philosophy” par excellence. In his
later works, Bataille reserved the term
atheology  for this function. What  Kant will not
admit without risking the edifi  ce of his
critical philosophy,  Bataille will embrace
and transform into a paradoxical unfounded
founda-tion. What Kant breaks down into
ontotheology, cosmotheology, and
phys-icotheology, and to which he assigns a
regulatory function vis-à-vis the faculty of
reason, is for Bataille the core problem of
philosophical think-ing. His notebooks on
atheology are exemplary of this kind of
speculative thinking: The expression of
thought descends with me in the mystical, and
the  privileged object of the mystical regains
its proper place . . .By contrast, I’ve
previously talked about by refusal of all
presupposi-tion. But I’m talking of God, I
think of God,Is not God the most basic
presupposition of thought?I don’t doubt this,
but this fatal presupposition is itself given
in the in-exorable movement of thought, it is no
less given than it is, ultimately, the fact of
its absence. Atheology expresses the fact that
human think- ing is above all placed before God
and then before his absence. 31 The term
atheology is not exactly the negation of or the
opposition to the- ology. Neither is it simply
an inversion of theology (that is, a
demonology). It is an “a-theology,” a theology
that is beside or alongside, a theology that is
without a center, without a “head,” a headless
or acephalous theology. 32 The term atheology
also described for Bataille an ongoing and
never- completed work that he reworked and
revised continually: La Somme  Athéologique .
The title references the Scholastic tradition
of the Summa ,  being at once a compendium of
central concepts and arguments, as well as a
kind of philosophical manifesto. If Aquinas’
Summa Theologica  is the  pinnacle of this genre
of writing, then Bataille’s La Somme
Athéologique   would be at once its negation and
its logical conclusion. 33

  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 263
Portions of this project were published
individually during Bataille’s  lifetime,
though the project as a whole underwent
continuous reorgani- zation. This was to be, in
effect, Bataille’s magnum opus, the defi 
nitive  statement of his philosophy, which
would encompass a cluster of themes  center to
Bataille’s writing: expenditure, eroticism
and mystical ecstasy, sacrifi  ce, base
materialism, the formless, political
economy, the excremen- tal, laughter, and the
death of God. But Bataille himself also wrote
aggres-sively against the very notion of
“project,” totality, and completion. Hence
the La Somme Athéologique  was doomed—or
fated—from the start. How- ever, this is more a
premise than a prohibition for Bataille. What
remains in the Oeuvres Complètes is, in a way, at
once incomplete and adequate  to Bataille’s
philosophical project—meditations,
fragments, aphorisms, notes, outlines, and
miscellaneous scraps of paper. In his numerous
notes and drafts for the project, Bataille
occasionally  offers a defi  ni ti on of th e term a
th eo l ogy . Som etim es i t is defi  ned in Ni-
etzschean terms, as “the science of the death or
destruction of God.” 34 At  other points
Bataille will expand his defi  nition, and
atheology becomes  the study of negation in
itself. And at still other moments, Bataille
con-ceives of atheology as the study of
contradiction that is reminiscent of the
negative theology of the Pseudo-Dionysius:
The term atheology  can not be misunderstood.
Owing to the fact that  t h e o l o g y  s u b o r d i n a t e s  i t 
t o  i t s  i n t e n t i o n s ,  God is impious  . . . The  Somme
Athéologique will indicate the only
possibility of approach- ing, of highlighting
the attraction that it allows us to undergo, and
the  interior but communicable luminosity of
life.35 For Bataille, “life” is neither simply
the biological organism nor the en- s o u l e d  o r  e x
p e r i e n t i a l  s u b j e c t — i t  i s  i n s t e a d  t h e  n e g a t i o n 
a t  t h e  c o r e  o f  both of them. Nearly all of
Bataille’s key terms—excess, expenditure,
gift— assert a negativity at the heart of
givenness and the superlative. In  Scholastic
terms, “life” becomes for Bataille the concept
that erodes both God and the animal, the
sovereign and the beast, Creator and creature.
“Life” is a necessary concept for La Somme
Athéologique , but only inso- far as it
functions negatively. Bataille’s ontology of
life is also difficult to pin down. It is, at
best, a di- chotomous ontology in which pairs of
opposites are put into play, continu-ally
undergoing inversions and perversions—the
erotic and the mystical, death and ecstasy,
expenditure and gift, and so on. Nevertheless,
a con-
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    279
    </p></div><p>
    
 264 chapter five cept of “life” is central for
Bataille’s larger philosophical project. On
the  one hand, Bataille’s works appear to
privilege the interiority of the sub-ject, the
inner experience that constitutes the
individuated living being: “It is necessary to
live the grand problems, by the body and by the
spirit.” 36  But Bataille will always extend
this inquiry to its absolute, at the point where
interiority becomes isomorphic with a sort of
exteriority, the body and the spirit turned
inside-out: “Living beings, human beings,
cannot  communicate— live—other than outside
of themselves.” 37 All of Bataille’s  emphases
on inner experience entail a movement of
opening, wounding,  unfurling, fl  ooding:
“[T]o live signifi  es for you not only the fl  ux
and play  of light that unifi  es itself in you, but
the channels of heat or of light from  one being to
another.”38 It would be easy to read passages
like these either within the frame- work of a
phenomenology of affect, or within the
framework of a romantic philosophy of the
subject. Indeed, large portions of the project
essentially abandon philosophy for
speculative mysticism and poetry.
Nevertheless, this language, with all of its
romantico-naturalistic images of fl  ux and fl 
ow,  must be read in the context of La Somme
Athéologique . Among Bataille’s  references,
one often reads the names of John of the Cross,
the Pseudo-Dionysius, Meister Eckhart, and
Angela di Foligno. This is as much a sty-listic
as it is a conceptual strategy. The tradition of
“darkness  mysticism”— from The Dark Night of
the Soul  to The Cloud of  Unknowing —is omni-
present in Bataille’s La Somme Athéologique .
It takes up one of the central  themes of the
tradition of darkness mysticism: the
utterance of the un-utterable, which
dovetails into language negating itself; and
the thought of
that-which-cannot-be-thought, which
dovetails into thought negating itself. For
all this, however, Bataille never simply
dismisses or dispenses with  something
tenuously called “philosophy.” This
naturalistic language of fl ux and fl  ow is not
just about superlative or divine generosity;
it is also, for  Bataille, the language of
negation and nihil . What appears, on the
surface,  to be a variant of either
phenomenological or existential refl  ection
on the  subject—that is, a Kantian elaboration
of ontotheology—is really the dis-solution of
interiority, an interiority that grounds the
human as a point of reference for thought. The
subject side of the correlation is never
isolated, but is “the activity that links the
innumerable elements that compose you to the
intensive communication of these elements
among themselves.” 39  Furthermore, this
topology contains “contagions of energy, of
movement, of heat or the transfer of elements,
that constitute the interiority of your
organic life.” 40 In this process, “where you
would like to know your eter-

  logic and life (on kantian teratology) 265 nal
substance, you meet nothing but a sliding [
glissement ], nothing but a  disordered game of
your perishable elements.”41 In fact, for
Bataille, life is most manifest at the moment
that its latent  negativity comes into the
foreground, to affirm it. Bataille’s emphasis
on  the political dynamics of gift and sacrifi  ce
aim to serve as examples of this  negative
affirmation, as does his concept of
“expenditure.” For Bataille, an ontology of
life cannot help but to be a negative ontology:
And the spirit is so closely linked to the body
that the latter never  ceases to be haunted by the
former, not even at the limit, the point where
spirit is never more present than when death
reduces it to the status of a thing . . . In this
sense the cadaver is the most perfect af-fi
rmation of the spirit. It is even the essence of
the spirit to reveal the  defi nitive
powerlessness of death, in the same way that the
cry of that  cadaver is the supreme affirmation
of life. 42 Against the dominant notion of life
as superlative fl  owing-forth, life for Ba-
taille functions through what the
Pseudo-Dionysius calls the via negativa .  It is
not that Life and Death become
introconvertible, as if along a kind of 
animistic continuum. But neither is it the case
that the vital processes of growth and decay
continually build upon each other (and this in
spite of Bataille’s eccentric appropriation
of Hegelian dialectics). Rather, the
“su-preme affirmation of life” is revealed
insofar as life was always, in itself,
“nothing.” The problem of a notion of life as
generosity is that one must account for both a
cause and a teleology that would condition that
gener-osity. This is as true for
phenomenology, as it is for process
philosophy, as it is for Deleuzian
biophilosophy. If life is generosity, gift,
givenness, and if one refuses the
onto-theological option of a life- principle,
much less  divine cause of life, then it would
seem that only a few options remain. One of them
is to question the presumption that life must
somehow be identical with affirmation,
generosity, and givenness. Another is to
ques-tion the logical consistency that any
ontology of life would  presuppose— there is no
cause of life except life itself; there is no fi 
nality of life except  life itself, etc. If we
take these two options together—life as
negative ( ni- hil), and life as
contradictory—we have, in short, a version of
Bataille’s  atheology: “Death reveals life in
its plentitude and darkens the order of the
real.” 43 At its extreme point, Bataille’s
ontology of life becomes nothing but  this
interior exteriority, a movement of
“contagion” that is immanent, not because it is
a plenum  or a fullness, but because it is, in the
manner of 
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    281
    </p></div><p>
    
 266 chapter five Eriugena’s nihil , an
immanence of nothing: “Immanence does not sup-
press the void but only the transcendence of the
void.”44 If Bataille does  put forward an
ontology of life, it would therefore have to be
an ontology  of life that is coextensive with
nihil. At times Bataille calls this “negative 
immanence.”45 In another note, this
pervasiveness of nihil  is rendered at  once
theological and epidemiological, what
Bataille calls theopathy : “In  theopathy the
position of the transcendent disappears
beneath its own  transcendence like a game of
mirrors.”46 It would be tempting to refer to
this as cosmic contagion , if the phrase  did not
have undue mystical connotations. Whatever
the case, Bataille’s ontology of life, like his
epistemology of the subject, attempts to
rethink life in terms of its own negation. Such
an atheology must ultimately be-come the
“horror” of thought: “I would like to
vigorously affirm the link between thought and
horror. Far from being associated with an
overpower-ing fear or with the cries of horror,
it seems to me that thought is beside   the world
and the being that it expresses.” 47 The “horror
of life” evoked here is not that of existential
crises or Hei- deggerian Angst . It is,
arguably, a Kantian horror: the horror of the
noume- nal as that which can be thought and
un-thought at the same time. There is not any of
the gothic or melodramatic in Bataille’s
atheological horror, despite his affinity for
the poetry of mysticism. This is less a horror of
an interiority confronting nothingness than a
horror that is the neutral, anonymous nothing
of interiority itself. For Bataille, what
atheological thinking does is to take the
contradictions at the heart of any ontology of
life, and make of them an ontological
principle. What must necessarily re-sult is a
concept predicated on the thought of its own
negation: life as the conjunction of immanence
and nothing—or really, a nothing that must
necessarily follow from a principle of
immanence. This ontology is also
indissociable from an antinomial logic that is
implicitly posed by Kant: is there an a priori of
life? 5.5 THE NIGHT LAND We began, in the
introduction, with a brief look at the weird fi 
ction of  H. P. Lovecraft. There we suggested
that the weird creatures in Lovecraft’s
stories are less “monsters” in the traditional
sense—implying an episte-mological
framework of normal and abnormal—and more
about the very intelligibility of life as such.
We will close with a brief and informal
medi-tation on another work in the
supernatural horror tradition, William Hope
Hodgson’s The Night Land .

Lauded by the likes of Lovecraft and Clark
Ashton Smith, The Night  Land  is a strange
mixture of lowbrow genre writing—part dark
fantasy,  part science fi  c ti o n ,  p art  ro man ce . 
Pu b lis h ed  in  1 9 1 2 ,  The Night Land ’s  conceptual
innovation is matched only by its difficulty as
a read—and this  is, to be sure, part of its charm.
It is written in a style that evokes the
ro-manticism of Blake’s prophecies, but
without the latter’s economy of prose or dense
symbolism. It has only a skeletal
plot—concerning a quest and a journey—that
itself dissolves against the backdrop of the
endless descrip-tions of the Night Land itself
(over 400 pages in two volumes in the
Bal-lantine paperback edition). 48 It
describes an imminent end—the extinction  of
the human, and perhaps of thought itself—which
never really comes to an end, but instead simply
drags on. But what it lacks in style or
composi-tion, it makes up for in
conceptualization. The Night Land  is a perfect
al- legory of the “horror of thought”
implicitly evoked by Kant, and explicitly
elaborated by Bataille. The Night Land 
describes a far-future world in which the sun
has long  burnt out, and the remnants of humanity
have enclosed themselves in the Last Redoubt: a
huge metallic pyramid, some 10 miles tall and
over 100 miles deep, which contains thousands
of “cities” within the various levels of the
pyramid. It is encircled by a force-fi  eld,
itself powered by an  “earth-current,” which is
continually being depleted. The Last Redoubt
is constantly besieged by an entire panoply of
creatures that remain incom-prehensible to
those remaining human beings within the
Redoubt. Entire scholastic communities have
formed—the “Monstruwacans”—dedicated to the
study of these unknown and incomprehensible
creatures. These life forms are not named, but
only described—that is, their
incomprehensibil-ity results in the
substitution of description for (taxonomic)
naming: aside from the more familiar creatures
of supernatural horror (giants, hounds, and
mutant “Ab-humans”), there is the “Watching
Thing of the South,” the “Headland From Which
Strange Things Peer,” the “Road Where Si-lent
Ones Walk,” and the inimitable “Country Whence
Comes the Great Laughter.” What’s more, many of
the creatures in the Night Land are only
liminally living—the “Watchers” appear to be
huge, sentient, mountain-like geological
formations with “eyes” that continually and fi 
xedly gaze  at the Last Redoubt. There are also
extra-dimensional entities, such as a lurking
“Heap of Black Mist,” the “Doorway in the
Night,” and a “House of Silence.” In one sense,
the architectonics of The Night Land  is
decidedly Kant- ian. Within the Last Redoubt is
the human subject, the world of phenom-ena and
the pour soi . The scholars of the Last Redoubt

observation towers. But they only gaze into
shadows,  can only describe half-discerned
shapes, and what they can discern ap-pears to
be, in turn, watching them. The scholars of the
Last Redoubt are like naturalists visiting a
strange land, having brought the wrong
bestiary with them. Not only are they unable to
analyze and classify the life of the Night Land,
they are unable to distinguish the living from
the nonliving. In the Night Land, everything
appears to be alive, but none of it is alive in any
naturalistic, let alone humanistic, sense of
the term. They are effec-tively in Kant’s
position vis-à-vis the question of
purposiveness and order of life—able to
comprehend that there is something “out
there,” but un-able to think that something in
itself. The Night Land  encapsulates, in a kind
of philosopheme, the di- lemma of the ontology
of life, from Aristotle’s  entelechy, through
post-  Aristotelian Scholasticism, to Kant’s
antinomy of Life. This is why, as we  stated in the
introduction, supernatural horror is one of
the paradigms for the concept of “life”
today—not because of the fear of death, and not
be-cause of the crises that populate life, but
because of a furtive, miasmatic
unintelligibility that inhabits any ontology
of life: the idea of a “life” that is not simply an
anthropomorphic, human-centric idea of life.
But to think this is to question the nature of
thought itself. And that unintelligibility is
itself a concept, or rather a limit-concept,
that poses a basic dilemma: to think a concept of
life that is itself, in some basic way, unhuman,
a life without us . 49

 269preface 1. Paul Éluard, L’Amour la poésie
(1929).  chapter 1 1. This motif of the “ancient
alien” is certainly not unique to Lovecraft. In
the  nineteenth century, Flammarion and Wells
dwelt on the topic, and in the latter part of  the
twentieth century one repeatedly fi  nds it in TV
shows such as In Search Of . . . and  X-Files , as
well as in a whole host of fi  lms, from Planet of
the Vampires  to Alien , not to  mention occult art
fi  lms such as Lucifer Rising  . . .  2. H. P.
Lovecraft, “The Shadow Out of Time,” in The
Dreams in the Witch House  and Other Weird
Stories , ed. S. T. Joshi (New York: Penguin,
2004), p. 393. 3. H. P. Lovecraft, At the
Mountains of Madness,  in The Thing on the
Doorstep and  Other Weird Stories , ed. S. T.
Joshi (New York: Penguin, 2001), p.  330. 4. In
fact, Jonathan Barnes suggests that one read
texts such as the De Anima  as a  series of lecture
notes, rather than polished literary works, as
one fi  nds in Plato’s early  and middle
dialogues. 5. Here and elsewhere I rely on the
standard accounts given by Aristotle scholars 
such as: J. L. Ackrill, Aristotle the
Philosopher (Oxford: Oxford University
Press, 1961), Jonathan Barnes, Aristotle 
(Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), G. E.
R. Lloyd, Ar- istotle: The Growth and Structure
of His Thought  (Cambridge: Cambridge
University  Press, 1968). 6. There exists an
English translation of the Moerbeke edition,
along with Aquinas’  commentary. See
Commentary on Aristotle’s “De Anima,” trans.
Kenelm Foster and Silvester Humphries (Notre
Dame: Dumb Ox, 1994). 7. For instance, Aquinas
famously suggested that the Liber de Causis was
based not  on Aristotle but rather on Proclus;
indeed, sorting out the Aristotle from
Neoplatonism became one of the central
preoccupations of Scholastic philosophy. 8.
For an overview of commentary on the De Anima 
during these periods, see H. J.  Blumenthal,
Aristotle and Neoplatonism in Late Antiquity
(Ithaca: Cornell University NOTES
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>

 Press, 1996), and Richard Sorabji, Philosophy
of the Commentators, 200–600 A.D.: A 
Sourcebook, vol. 1—Psychology  (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 2005). 9. Most of
the English translations of the early and mid
twentieth century main- tained the Latin title
De Anima , such as those by Hicks (1907), Smith
(1956), Ross (1961),  and Hamlyn (1968). An
important early exception is the Hett
translation (1936) in the Loeb Classical
Library, which uses the title On the Soul .
Recent translations such as  the Penguin
Classics edition by Lawson-Tancred (1986),
retain the English term “soul.” However even
Lawson-Tancred notes, in the glossary to the
book, that the term psyche   would be “ideally,
but impossibly, rendered ‘principle of
animation.’” 10. For an overview of this
approach in modern Aristotle scholarship, see
G. E. R.  Lloyd, “Aspects of the Relationship
between Aristotle’s Psychology and his
Zoology,” in Essays on Aristotle’s “De Anima,”
ed. Martha Nussbaum and Amélie Oksenberg Rorty 
(Oxford: Clarendon, 1999), pp. 147–68. Also
see the collection Aristotle on Nature and
Living Things , ed. Allan Gotthelf
(Pittsburgh: Mathesis, 1985). 11. One debate
concerns a version of the philosophy of mind,
presented with decid- edly Aristotelian
conclusions, by Hilary Putnam, in “Philosophy
and Our Mental Life,” Mind, Language, and
Reality: Philosophical Papers (Cambridge:
Cambridge University Press, 1975), pp.
291–303. This has prompted a dialogue and
collaboration with Aristotle scholar Martha
Nussbaum on the possibility of an Aristotelian
philosophy of mind—and its ensuing
criticisms. See M. F. Burnyeat’s critique in
the collection Essays on  Aristotle’s “De
Anima,” ed. Martha Nussbaum and Amélie
Oksenberg Rorty (Oxford: Clarendon, 1999),
pp. 15–26. 12. Brentano’s study was originally
published in German in 1867, and translated 
into English as The Psychology of Aristotle ,
trans. Rolf George (Berkeley: University of 
California Press, 1977). It is worth pointing
out the link between Husserl, who studied for a
time with Brentano, and Heidegger, who of
course studied with Husserl. That one of
Heidegger’s early lecture courses is
dedicated to the concept of “factical life” in
Aristotle is therefore noteworthy. 13. Here I
am in accord with recent scholarship that
attempts to raise the question  of “life” in the
De Anima , in particular: William Charlton,
“Aristotle’s Defi  nition of  Soul,” in
Aristotle’s “De Anima” in Focus , ed. Michael
Durrant (New York: Routledge,  1993), pp.
197–216, and Gareth Matthews, “ De Anima  2.2–4
and the Meaning of Life ,”  in Essays on
Aristotle’s “De Anima,” ed. Martha Nussbaum
and Amélie Oksenberg  Rorty (Oxford:
Clarendon, 1999), pp. 185–94. However, I am
departing from studies such as these in
suggesting the role that contradiction plays
as a necessary element in the Aristotelian
concept of life. J. L. Ackrill’s essay
“Aristotle’s Defi  nitions of psuchê ” 
(Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society  73
[1972–73], pp. 119–33) remains an insightful 
contribution in this regard, in that it
systematically points out the lacunae in
under-standing “life” ontologically in the De
Anima —a reading that the De Anima  neverthe-
less encourages from its very fi  rst sentences.

 17. Ibid., II.2.413a. 18. Interestingly, the
terms bíos and zoeˉ are more frequently
utilized than psukhe ˉ  in the opening passages
of the Politica . In contemporary philosophy,
Giorgio Agamben  makes much of the distinction
between bíos  and zoe ˉ, as it forms the boundary
around  which the political relation between
sovereign and the “bare life” that is caught in
the state of exception. However, Agamben does
not comment on how psukhe ˉ, as that  which
conditions the very distinction of bíos and zoe
ˉ, also conditions the relation  of politics to
“life itself.” Roberto Esposito’s book Bíos
does take up this question,  though Esposito
emphasizes a different boundary—the modern
medical metaphor of immunity and
immunization. See Homo Sacer , trans. Daniel
Heller-Roazen (Stanford:  Stanford

Daniela Ginsburg (New York: Fordham

terminology in La Connaissance de la Vie can
appear  somewhat irregular. For instance, he
will use the term vie in some instances to refer
to  life in general (including the experience of
living), and in other instances to refer to the
Aristotelian ontological concept Life.
Likewise, the term vivant  can sometimes mean 
the life of biological organisms in general
(e.g., as species), and at other times to refer
to the individual organism in its singularity.
Arguably, both of these usages of vivant  are 
equivalent to “the living.” 23. Martin

dona eis. One of the ironies of classical music
during the  early modern period is that the
development of the Requiem Mass takes place
roughly concurrent with the fl  owering of
polyphonic choral music. The Requiem—perhaps
the  darkest of the liturgical rites—is also
among those musical forms that, at an early
stage, incorporates polyphonic elements into
its structure. The Mass for the Dead, which so
clearly enunciates its gothic themes in the
passages of the Requiem Aeternam (“Eternal 
Rest”) and the Dies Irae  (“Day of Wrath”), is in
musical terms the greatest expression  of life,
with its multitude of interdependent and
interweaving voices. The earliest 
Requiems—by Dufay, Ockeghem, Brumel—give
expression to this inner antagonism. notes to

 19. This is, generally speaking, a motif
present in nearly all of the late Derrida. See, 
for example, The Gift of Death / Literature in
Secret , trans. David Wills (Chicago: Uni-
versity of Chicago Press, 2007), as well as the
fascinating piece “How to Avoid Speak- ing:
Denials,” in Derrida and Negative Theology ,
eds. Harold Coward and Toby Foshay  (Albany:
State University of New York Press, 1992). One
should also mention the work of Jean-Luc
Marion, who more directly brings the themes of
continental philosophy to bear on negative
theology. See Jean-Luc Marion, God Without
Being , trans. Thomas  Carlson (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 1995), pp. 53ff.
20. While in Athens, Paul preaches in the
Areopagus: “When they heard about  the
resurrection of the dead, some of them sneered,
but others said, ‘We want to hear you again on
this subject.’ At that, Paul left the Council. A
few men became followers of Paul and believed.
Among them was Dionysius, a member of the
Areopagus, also a woman named Damaris, and a
number of others” (Acts 17:32–34, New
International Version). Interestingly, Paul
notes an idol marked “The Unknown God,” a phrase
that perhaps bears some relation to what the
Pseudo-Dionysius calls “The Unnameable One.”
21. In a report titled “Epistle of Innocent the
Maronite concerning a Conference  Held with the
Severians,” the authorship of Dionysius the
Areopagite is questioned in the same breath as
Dionysius’ works are fi  rst named as a single
body of work (the  Corpus Areopagiticum ). By the
early fi  fteenth century, Italian
Neoplatonist philoso- phers could show, by
comparing passages of the Pseudo-Dionysius
with his Neoplatonic infl uences, that the
author of the Corpus Areopagiticum  could not
have been Dionysius  the Areopagite. But just
who the author is remains a mystery. Numerous
arguments have been given for the identity of
the Pseudo-Dionysius, though indisputable
docu-mentation is lacking. The greatest
evidence seems to be that of textual
comparison: the Corpus Areopagiticum  shows
the marked infl  uence of the Neoplatonic
thinker  Proclus (412–485), and the fi  rst
undisputed reference to the
Pseudo-Dionysius’ works  is by the monophysite
thinker Severus of Antioch (ca. 518–528), so,
the reasoning goes, the Pseudo-Dionysius must
have been working sometime in the late fi  fth to
early sixth  century. 22. Of the many secondary
works on the Pseudo-Dionysius, the following
have  been instrumental in this study: Dierdre
Carabine, The Unknown God: Negative The- ology
in the Platonic Tradition  (Grand Rapids:
Eerdmans Publishing, 1995); Jon Jones, 
“Sculpting God: The Logic of Dionysian
Negative Theology,” Harvard Theological 
Review  89.4 (1996): 355–71; Andrew Louth,
Denys the Areopagite  (London: Continuum, 
2002), 99ff.; Michael Sells, Mystical
Languages of Unsaying  (Chicago: University of 
Chicago Press, 1994); Denys Turner, The
Darkness of God: Negativity in Christian 
Mysticism  (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1995), 19–49. Turner’s book is espe-
cially insightful concerning the role of
negation in negative theology generally. 23.

absolutely evil. For if evil is imperfect
Goodness, the complete absence of the Good will
do away with complete and incomplete goodness.
Evil will only be and be seen by contrast with
what it opposes, for it will be distinct from
them, since they are good. The fact is that
things of the same kind cannot wholly
contradict each other in the same respects. And
so it is that evil is not a being”

Of these Moran’s work is especially
interesting in that it  achieves a nice balance
between the historical onto-theological
context of the Periphy- seon  and its
juxtaposition to the modern philosophical
debates surrounding idealism.  The essays by
Jeauneau, Moran, and Otten are particularly
interesting in their discus-sion of nihil . 70.

luceat eis. While the Requiem Mass is in its
content concerned  with death, in its musical
form it is concerned with life (the life of
polyphony). In the arrangement of the Proper
and Ordinary sections it is also concerned with
narrative: one begins in darkness and ascends
towards the light. Something different occurs
in the Tenebrae , the collection of Matins and
Lauds traditionally performed during Holy 
Week. In its traditional form, a candle is
extinguished after each section until the last
one, which is sung in total darkness ( in
tenebris ). Like the Requiem, the Tenebrae 
theo- logically implies a coming
transcendence, though in the former the theme
is that of the afterlife, while in the latter the
theme is that of resurrection. Unlike the
Requiem, however, the Tenebrae —at least in the
examples of Gesualdo or Victoria—is not so  much
a teleologically driven work as it is a
sustained musical meditation on the themes of
darkness and sorrow. notes to pages 79–95 277

of Psalms , ed. Philip Schaff (Peabody: Hen-
drickson, 1999), section 16. 2. We can, of
course, expand these forms of life to include
mineralogical, noologi- cal, or cosmological
life, but such an expansion of phyla still
relies on this basic distinc- tion of the life
form and the life-that-forms. Thus, from a
certain perspective, even “nonorganic life”
must presume the Aristotelian framework—if
only to annul it after the fact. 3. In the De Anima 
Aristotle merely makes the distinction
between psukhe ¯ con- sidered in itself and
psukhe ¯ as particular to the plant, animal, or
human strata. In the  biological treatises,
attempts to connect Life and the living are even
more scant, though there are passages in works
such as the Historia Animalium  in which the
central argu- ment of the De Anima  is in effect
summarized. 4. While the term “pantheism” is
not commonly used until the eighteenth
century,  the concept itself—of God being
identical with Nature—remains an issue of some
controversy. By the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, the term begins to be used
with some regularity in histories of Western
philosophy to describe the work of thinkers
such as Spinoza. See, for example, Étienne
Gilson’s two-volume La philosophie  au
moyen-âge  (Paris: Payot, 1922). 5. Standard
accounts in the history of philosophy include:
Frederick Copleston, A  History of Medieval
Philosophy  (Notre Dame: University of Notre
Dame Press, 1972);  Étienne Gilson, The Spirit
of Mediaeval Philosophy  (Notre Dame:
University of Notre  Dame Press, 1991); Anthony
Kenny, Medieval Philosophy  (Oxford: Oxford
University  Press, 2007). 6. The process is
broadly as follows: fi  rst take a creaturely
attribute, such as “this  life,” then take away
the creaturely limit term “this” (resulting in
“life itself” or Life), then take the attribute
in itself and maximize it (“eternal life” or
“spiritual life” or superlative life), then
take this term—however compromised—and
render it equivalent to the divine (“God is
eternal life,” etc.). 7. See the wonderful
collection The Monstrous Middle Ages , ed.
Bettina Bildhauer  and Robert Mills (Toronto:
University of Toronto Press, 2004). 8. See The
Book of Beasts, Being a Translation from a Latin
Bestiary of the Twelfth  Century , ed. T. H. White
(New York: Dover, 1984). 9. Part of the reason
may be historical—though Aristotle’s works in
logic were  known to Medieval thinkers, it was
only in the twelfth century that the works in
natural philosophy were translated into
Latin. These works were often not direct
translations from Greek, but re-translations
via Arabic and Syriac, or sometimes both.
Furthermore, as was the tradition, Arabic
scholars often commented extensively on
Aristotle’s texts, so much so that it is often
difficult to distinguish a commentary text by,
say, Averroës, from the source text of
Aristotle. It is for this reason that Aristotle
simply became known as “the Philosopher” to the
Scholastics, while Averroës became “the
Commentator.” 10. Thomas Aquinas, The

Theologiae, Questions on God , ed. Brian Davies 
and Brian Leftow (Cambridge: Cambridge
University Press, 2006). The Thomistic 
secondary scholarship is massive, and I cite
here only those recent works that have been
directly useful: W. Norris Clarke, “Analogy
and the Meaningfulness of Language about God,”
in Explorations in Metaphysics:
Being—God—Person  (Notre Dame: University  of
Notre Dame Press, 1994); Anthony Kenny,
Aquinas on Being (Oxford: Oxford Uni- versity
Press, 2003); Ralph McInerny, Aquinas and
Analogy  (Washington, DC: Catholic  University
of America Press, 1996); Gregory Rocca,
Speaking the Incomprehensible One: Thomas
Aquinas on the Interplay of Positive and
Negative Theology  (Washing- ton, DC: Catholic
University of America Press, 2004). The
McInerny book is a standard account of
Thomistic analogy, while the book by Kenny
offers a useful account of Thomistic
onto-theology in relation to natural theology
and natural philosophy. An earlier, still
useful study along these lines is Anton Pegis,
St. Thomas and the Problem of the Soul in the
Thirteenth Century  (Toronto: Pontifi  cal
Institute of Medieval Studies,  1976 [1934]).
11. To summarize, Aquinas’ argument can be
outlined as follows: • The question: “Whether
what is said of God and of creatures is
univocally predicated of them?” • Objection 1:
It seems that they are univocal because all
equivocity reduces to univocity. • Obj. 2:
Since there is no likeness at all between
equivocal things, and since the creature is
made in the likeness of the Creator, it seems
that they are univocal. • Obj. 3: There is a
relation of likeness between measure and that
which is measured, cause and that which is
caused. God as the fi  rst measure is like  the
creatures that are measured. • On the contrary,
something can be predicated of two terms but not
in the same sense. One name can be given to many
things, but not with the same meaning. The name
of God is not God itself, since God is not a genus
or species. Further, God is not related to
creatures as along a spectrum, but is of a wholly
different order. • Answer: There is no
univocity between God and creatures because
one is the cause of the other, and each effect,
though it contains some aspect of the cause, is
also a lesser version of it. Each effect is
similar but less than its cause. What
imperfection is in the effect (creature),
perfection is in the cause (Creator). There is
no equivocity between God and creatures, since
then nothing at all could be naturally known
about God by creatures. Thus it must be said that
God and creatures are analogously related. •
There is the analogy of proportion—“health” of
a body is used in rela-tion to the terms “urine”
and “medicine,” but in different proportions
(a symptom/sign in the former and cause in the
latter). • There is the analogy of
proportionality—what A is to B, C is to D. • Reply
obj. 1: Although all equivocity reduces to
univocity, for all univocity  notes to page 108
279
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    295
    </p></div><p>
    
 there must be a fi  rst non-univocal agent that
precedes it, or else that con- tinues to infi 
nity (dialectic of univocity-equivocity).
This “universal agent”  is an analogical agent,
in which all univocity reduces to a unity, which
is  being. • Reply obj. 2: The likeness between
creature and God is by defi  nition imper- fect,
but this does not imply univocity. • Reply obj.
3: God is not a measure in proportion to the thing
measured since they are not in the same genus by
which measurement of them would be possible.

Ibid.16. This plays out in the actual
composition of texts as well, for while
Aristotle’s De  Anima  is relatively separate
from the works in biology, Medieval approaches
integrated  perspectives from classical
natural philosophy, natural theology, and
metaphysics into single texts that, in a
strangely interdisciplinary way, eschew any
neat divisions be-tween theology,
philosophy, and biology. Commentaries on
Aristotle are a good case in point, as evidenced
in William of Auvergne’s On the Soul  or The
Universe of Creatures . 17. A number of
secondary works have been helpful for my
reading of Duns Scotus.  These include: Richard
Cross, The Physics of Duns Scotus: The
Scientifi  c Context of a  Theological Vision 
(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998); Stephen
Dumont et al., “The Uni- vocity of the Concept of
Being in the Fourteenth Century,” Mediaeval
Studies  49–51  (1987–89); Stephen Dumont,
“Transcendental Being: Scotus and Scotists,”
Topoi  11  (1992): 135–49; Alexander Hall,
Thomas Aquinas and John Duns Scotus: Natural
Theol-ogy in the High Middle Ages (London:
Continuum, 2007); Peter King, “Duns Scotus on
the Common Nature and the Individual
Differentia,” Philosophical Topics  20
(1992):  51–76. The book by Hall is especially
relevant to the discussion here, as it teases
out the implications of Scotus’ concepts for
continental philosophy. In addition, earlier
studies by Gilson and Wolter remain relevant:
Étienne Gilson, Jean Duns Scot: Introductions
à  Ses Positions Fondamentales  (Paris: Vrin,
2001 [1952]), and Allan Wolter, Transcenden-
tals and Their Function in the Metaphysics of
Duns Scotus (Washington, DC: Catholic
University of America Press, 1946). 18. In
Scholastic terminology, the original
lectures, or lectura , could be copied  down by a
student or scribe, and then known as a
reportatio . If lecture notes were later 
reedited, changed, or corrected by the author,
the work would be known as an ordina- tio. It is
thought that Scotus’ original lecture notes at
Oxford were later reedited over  a process of
several years between 1300 and 1304, that is,
between his tenure at Oxford and his move to
Paris. 19. We can outline the argument for
univocity given by Scotus as follows: • Q: Can
there be but one God? Is God one or many? Is God
univocal? • Pro • Biblical quote on “many gods
and many lords.” • If God exists, then gods exist
(singular implies plural). • Every single
thing can be traced back to its essence.280
notes to pages 109–116
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    296
    </p></div><p>
    
 • A greater number of good things is better than a
lesser number. • Necessity of existence (if
gods exist they are necessarily existing). •
Contra • Quote from Bible (“There is no God
besides me”). • Body of the Question: Let us
suppose God is One or univocal—is there a 
natural knowledge of this univocity? • First
Opinion: The univocity of God is known only by
faith. • Scotus’ Opinion: The univocity of God
is known by natural reason. Proofs for this: •
From infi  nite intellect. The knowledge of B by A
presupposes some- thing in “common” to both A
and  B. • From infi  nite will. The love of B by A
presupposes a “natural will”  that connects A
and  B. • From infi  nite goodness. The goodness of
A in B presupposes a will  or necessity of
goodness that fl  ows between A and  B. • From infi 
nite power. A (God) creates B and C by an act of
“total  cause,” not two Gods A and B creating a
single creature C. • From absolute infi  nity.
God as infi  n i t y  i s  a b s o l u t e  i n fi  nity, and  thus
“less than numerical” or “non-numerical”
since number is proper to creatures. • From
necessary being. The divine is
“indeterminate” in the infi  - nite, but it
determines multiple individuals. There is a
“formal ne-cessity” or distinction between an
individual and its nature. • From omnipotence.
• Reply to First Opinion: On singularity,
individuality, and the formal objective
distinction. • Reply to Pro Arguments • “Many
gods” refers to idols not actually God. •
“Number” is not applicable to the divine but to
things. • The essence of each essence is a single
essence God; “pure perfection” vs. “mixed
perfection.” 20. Duns Scotus, Opus Oxoniense ,

accurate to say that Scotus’ formal
distinction is a response  to the Medieval
debates over universals, particularly as
established by Abelard. In this way, Scotus can
be seen to be positioned somewhere between the
twelfth-century debates over universals and
the later Ockhamist debates over nominalism.

intentionally infl  ected through Deleuze, a

Deleuze have been helpful. This includes  older

Spinoza in relation to Scholas- ticism, as well
as more modern studies, such as Alexandre

being an operation itself indicates that the
one is a result . . . To put it more clearly, once
the entirety of a situation is subject to the law
of the one and consis-tency, it is necessary,
from the standpoint of immanence to the
situation, that the pure multiple . . . be
nothing . But being-nothing is as distinct from
non-being as the ‘there is’  is distinct from
being” (p. 53). notes to pages 140–154 283

staff at the University of Paris, and in some
cases “completed” from various student notes.
While parts of the collected Paris
lectures—known as the Reportata  Parisiensia
—do exist in a coherent form, and appear to have
been authorized by Scotus  himself, they are
complicated by biographical facts: Scotus

 around 1302, but was forced to leave Paris due to
the ongoing disputes of the time  between Pope
Boniface VIII and King Philip the Fair. When he
was allowed to return in 1304, he continued his
lectures. However, modern scholars have noted
a number of discrepancies in the Reportata 
between the original, written-down version
(by an  unknown scribe), an alternate version by
Scotus’ secretary William of Alnwick, and
Scotus’ own manuscripts and notes (in the Liber
Scoti ). 50. John Duns Scotus, Reportata

existence of God, as presented  in the Ordinatio 
I, dist. II, q. i: • Question: Among beings does
one exist that is actually infi  nite? • Replies
Pro and Contra • Body of the Question • Article I:
The Relative Properties of God • Part I: The
Triple Primacy • Primacy of efficient
causality • Conclusion 1: “Among beings which
can produce an effect one is simply fi  rst.” •
Conclusion 2: “Among those things that can
produce an effect that which is simply fi  rst is
itself incapable of being  caused.” •
Conclusion 3: “Such a being actually exists and
some na-ture actually existing is capable of
such causality.” • Primacy of fi  nality • C o n c l u
s i o n  1 :  “ T h e  fi  rst conclusion is that some end  is
simply ultimate, that is, it can neither be
ordained to something else nor exercise its fi 
nality in virtue of some- thing else.” •
Conclusion 2: “The second conclusion is that
the ultimate end cannot be caused in any way.” •
Conclusion 3: “The third conclusion is that the
being which can be an ultimate end actually
exists and that this primacy pertains to some
actually existing nature.” • Primacy of
preeminence • Conclusion 1: “The fi  rst
conclusion is that some eminent  nature is
simply fi  rst in perfection.” • Conclusion 2:
“The second conclusion is that the supreme
nature cannot be caused.” • Conclusion 3: “The
third conclusion is that the supreme nature
actually exists.”286 notes to pages 189–192

“[T]he fi  rst efficient cause does not act
primarily or ultimately for the sake of 
anything distinct from itself; hence, it must
act for itself as an end; therefore, the fi  rst 
efficient cause is the ultimate end” (ibid.).
63. “The fi  rst efficient cause is not a univocal
cause with reference to the other  efficient
causes but rather an equivocal cause. Such a
cause, therefore, is more excellent and noble
than they” (ibid.). 64. “I say that since this
triple primacy is found together (for where one
is, there  also are the others), it follows
further that this triple identity is such that
there is but one fi  rst efficient cause
according to essence and nature” (ibid., pp.
49–50). 65. Ordinatio  I, dist. II, q. i, pt. III,

dark and sorrowful music of the Tenebrae ,  the
one composed by Carlo Gesualdo, known as the
Tenebrae Responsoria  (1611),  stands out in
both content and form. Gesualdo—aristocrat,
composer, depressive, and murderer—is
equally known for his madrigals, a poetic and
secular form of vocal music popular during the
Renaissance. He wrote both the music and, it is
thought, the words of his madrigals, which
express with great intensity and subtlety the
spectrum of af-fects dealing with
love—ecstasy and agony, joy and sorrow.
Gesualdo’s Tenebrae  pieces  are in many ways
madgrial-like; they contain formal
experiments in chromaticism and  notes to pages

 harmony that at times evoke a sense of spiritual
dissonance. In a sense, by composing  the
liturgical Tenebrae  in a way similar to the
secular madrigals, Gesualdo also shifted  this
spiritual dissonance from musical form to its
expressive content. Chapter 5 1. In this way
Kant’s views on nature are signifi  cantly
different from those of other  philosophers
working in and departing from the Idealist
tradition. On the Kantian “two-worlds”
physics (living vs. nonliving), and the
critique of it posed by Schelling, see Iain

All translations from Bataille’s Oeuvres 
Complètes  are my own. 32. Bataille’s use of the
term atheology must be thought of alongside his
earlier  social experiments of the 1930s, of
which the secret society Acéphale was
exemplary. During this period the group
published a journal, titled simply Acéphale .
André  Masson’s drawings for the journal are
emblematic of atheological thinking: a
headless yet living body politic. Much of the
contemporary secondary scholarship on
Bataille tends to elide his indebtedness to
Medieval philosophy and mysticism, despite
its obvious presence in nearly all of
Bataille’s works. Notable exceptions
include: Denis Hollier, Against
Architecture: The Writings of Georges
Bataille  (Cambridge: MIT Press,  1995 [1974]),
pp. 36ff; Bruce Hollsinger, The Premodern
Condition: Medievalism and the Making of
Theory  (Chicago: University of Chicago Press,
2005), pp. 27ff; Alexander  Irwin, Saints of the
Impossible: Bataille, Weil, and the Politics
of the Sacred  (Minne- apolis: University of
Minnesota Press, 2002), pp. 124ff; Nick Land,
The Thirst for An- nihilation  (New York:
Routledge, 1992); Allan Stoekl, Bataille’s
Peak: Energy, Religion,  and
Postsustainability  (Minneapolis:
University of Minnesota Press, 2007), pp.
60ff.  Hollier’s book has become somewhat of a
standard in Bataille studies, and offers an
earlier treatment of the theme of atheology.
33. Bataille’s plan for the S omme Athéologique 
went through numerous changes.  For instance,
around 1954, Bataille outlined the project as
follows: • Inner Experience  (L’Expérience
Intérieure ) • Guilty  (Le Coupable ) • On
Nietzsche  (Sur Nietzsche ) • Pure Happiness  (Le
Pur Bonheur ) • The Incomplete System of
Non-Knowledge  (Le Système Inachevé du 
Non-savoir ). The title “Somme Athéologique”
was fi  rst mentioned by Bataille in a letter to
Raymond  Queneau in 1949, and was advertised in
the 1954 edition of L’Expérience Intérieure , 
then subsequently modifi  ed after 1961 to
include only the fi  rst three volumes. Early 
outlines for the project included possible
volumes such as “The Sanctity of Evil” (La
Sainteté du Mal), “History of a Secret Society”
(Histoire d’une Société Secrete), and “To Die
from Laughing and to Laugh from Dying” (Mourir
de Rire et Rire de Mourir). 34. Bataille, “Plans
pour la somme athéologique.” Another of
Bataille’s defi  nitions  runs as follows: “Defi 
ne atheology: the science of the death or
destruction of God (the  notes to pages 258–263
291
    </p><div id="pagenum"><p>
    307

as it is a thing” (“Aphorisms for the ‘Sys-
tem,’” in The Unfi  nished System of
Nonknowledge , trans. Stuart and Michelle
Kendall  [Minneapolis: University of
Minnesota Press, 2004], p. 166). 35. “Plans

Bataille’s images of  fl ow and light are
frequent: “Furthermore, your life is not borne
along this impercep- tible, interior fl  owing;
it also fl  ows towards the outside and
incessantly opens itself . . .  The enduring
whirlpool that composes you runs up against
similar whirlpools with which it forms a vast
animated form of measured agitation” (ibid.).

goes without saying that there is no dancing 
during either the Requiem Mass or the Tenebrae .
As a music of shadows, sorrow, and  darkness, its
very content would seem to mitigate against
such a response. Neverthe-less, one fi  nds here
and there passages of overfl  owing life—the
Requiems of Brahms,  Verdi, and Berlioz almost
spill forth with their dazzling bright horns
and epic choruses, sounding more like the
Carmina Burana  than a Mass for the Dead. Indeed,
an earlier  period might have attributed such
contrasts to the infl  uence of the devil’s
music. But  beyond these contrasts of light and
darkness, sorrow and joy, there is also the
neutral plateau of a music that negates itself
as music. Such describes the Requiem of the
Hungarian composer György Ligeti. Ligeti’s
Requiem (1965) is an emptied music that pushes
formal elements such as melody and rhythm into a
background of nothingness. Not only do the
voices of the chorus cease to be voices and
become abstract sounds, but these sounds
themselves dissipate seamlessly into a space
above or below our sonic register that can be
described only as empty sound.292 notes to
